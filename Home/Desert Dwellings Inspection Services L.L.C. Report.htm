The purpose of the home inspection is to determine through visual means 
the condition of various systems and components of the home.<br>No 
inspection will pick up every minute latent defect. The inspector's 
ability to find all defects is limited by access to various parts of the
 property, lack of information and other factors. A good inspector will 
do his or her level best to determine the condition of the home and 
report it accurately. The report that is issued is an opinion as to the 
condition of the home on the day of inspection.The presence or extent of
 building code violations is not the subject of the inspection and is 
not included within the report.<br><br>A warranty is a policy sold to a 
buyer that warrants that specific items in the home are in sound 
condition and will remain so for a period of time.<br>It is essentially an insurance policy.<br><br>The
 service that we have provided you is an inspection. We make no warranty
 of this property. If you desire warranty coverage,please see your real 
estate agent for details about any plans that may be available. <br>

<span class="r12g"><b>General Notes: </b>Our inspection of the grounds 
includes a visual examination of grading, drainage, walkways, driveways,
 patios, fences, walls, gates and landscaping that may affect the 
foundation and/or building exterior.<br><br>The structural elements of 
most buildings include a perimeter foundation,footings,concrete floor 
slab,floor,wall,ceiling and roof framing.Our inspection of the structure
 includes a visual examination of the exposed portions of these areas 
whenever possible. These items are examined for proper 
function,excessive or unusual wear and general state of repair. Many 
structural components are inaccessible because they are buried below 
grade or behind finished surfaces. Therefore, much of the structural 
inspection was performed by identifying resultant symptoms of movement, 
damage and deterioration. Where there are no visible symptoms, 
conditions requiring further review or repair may go undetected and 
identification is not possible without destructive testing.<br>The 
inspection of the building exterior  includes a visual examination of 
the finished surfaces, wall cladding, siding,windows , 
doors,flashings,trim,fascia,eaves,soffits,decks, porches and railings.<br>These
 items are examined for proper function, excessive wear and general 
state of repair. Components may not be visible because of 
soil,vegetation,storage and/or the nature of construction. In such cases
 these items are considered inaccessible and not part of the inspection.</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Footing material: </b>Poured in place concrete</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Foundation material: </b>Poured in place concrete</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Apparent wall structure: </b>Wood frame</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Wall covering: </b>Composition wood panels</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Two Story Structure: </b>No</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Floor structure: </b>Slab on grade</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Columns: </b>Wood</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Trim / Soffit / Fascia: </b>Wood</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Damaged Exterior Wood: </b>No</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Driveway material: </b>Poured in place concrete</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Patio: </b>Concrete</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Sidewalk material: </b>Poured in place concrete</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Fence/Wall: </b>Block</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Gate: </b>Functional</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Gutters: </b>n/a</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Chimney Chase: </b>n/a</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Deck/Balcony: </b>n/a</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Windows: </b>Metal</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Screens: </b>Not Installed</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Exterior door material: </b>Sliding glass, Hollow core wood</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Exterior Door Weatherstripping: </b>Installed</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Exterior Stairs: </b>Yes</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Railing / Balusters: </b>Not Installed, Safety Hazard</span><hr style="clear:both;">

One or more outdoor electric receptacles appear to have no ground fault 
circuit interrupter (GFCI) protection. This is a safety hazard due to 
the risk of shock. A qualified electrician should evaluate to determine 
if GFCI protection exists, and if not, repairs should be made so that 
all outdoor receptacles within six feet six inches of ground level have 
GFCI protection. For example, install GFCI receptacles or circuit 
breaker(s) as needed. ( At the west and northwest sidewalls )

One or more outside faucets are missing <a href="http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/BODY_AE079" target="NEW" class="r12l">backflow prevention devices</a>.
 These devices reduce the likelihood of polluted or contaminated water 
entering the potable water supply. This condition can occur when an 
outside faucet is left in the "on" position with a hose connected and 
the sprayer head turned off. When pressure in the system fluctuates, 
water can be drawn back into the water supply pipes from the house. If a
 chemical sprayer is being used with the hose, those chemicals can enter
 the water supply pipes. <br><br>Recommend installing backflow 
prevention devices on all exterior hose bibs where missing. They are 
available at most home improvement stores and are easily installed. For 
more information, visit: <a href="http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/BODY_AE079" target="NEW" class="r12l">http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/BODY_AE079</a>

One or more flights of stairs with more than three risers have no

This property is clad with composition wood fiber siding. Many brands of
 this type of siding by different manufacturers are known to deteriorate
 and/or fail prematurely due to moisture penetration. Failure is 
typically visible in the form of swelling, cracking and delamination, 
especially at the bottom edges.  Class action lawsuits have been filed 
or are being filed against most manufacturers of this material. <br><br>Some
 areas of siding on this structure show the symptoms described above, 
but it appears that the siding hasn't deteriorated to the point of 
needing replacement. Some manufacturers (Louisiana Pacific) recommend a 
repair process for this siding where affected areas are sealed with 
"Permanizer Plus", a flexible primer made by Pittsburgh Paint, followed 
by two coats of 100% acrylic latex paint. This sealant must be applied 
to the bottom edges using a brush. The face of the siding can be 
sprayed. The "Permanizer Plus" sealer isn't required for edges that 
aren't swollen, cracked or deteriorated, but the acrylic latex should 
still be brushed on these edges.<br><br>At a minimum, recommend having a
 qualified contractor seal and repaint as described above, or by other 
methods specified by the siding's manufacturer. The client(s) may wish 
to have a qualified contractor evaluate further to determine if some or 
all of the siding should be replaced.<br><br>For more information, visit:<br><a href="http://www.ppg.com/ppgaf/pl1198.htm" target="NEW" class="r12l">Pittsburgh Paints, PRIMERS -THE FOUNDATION FOR A TOP QUALITY JOB</a><br><a href="http://www.siding4u.com/failing_siding_help.htm" target="NEW" class="r12l">Failing LP Siding Help Page</a>

The water heater in the garage is installed so flames and/or sources of 
spark are less than 18 inches above the floor. Standard building 
practices require that the open flame or source of spark for appliances 
in a garage be located at least 18 inches above the floor. Fuel vapors 
from vehicles, storage containers or other sources are heavier than air 
and may ignite when exposed to pilot lights, sparks or open flames. This

No filter is visible for the heating/cooling system. As a result, 
unfiltered air will flow through the system, and the heating/cooling 
equipment life and the indoor air quality may be reduced. Correctly 
sized filter(s) should be installed. If necessary, guides or retaining 
devices should be installed or repaired so filter(s) are securely 
anchored and gaps around edges are minimized.

Heat pumps are air conditioners designed to operate " in either 
direction."  When heating, air is cooled and exhausted to the outside, 
while the waste heat is distributed through the living space by a blower
 and ductwork. <br>Due to extreme outside temperatures, the heating 
cycle of the heat pump will not be tested. Generally, industry standards
 recommend not running the heating cycle in high heat conditions, or the
 cooling cycle in extreme cold weather. Typically, a positive test of 
either the heating or cooling mode verifies all of the major components 
of the system are functional. However, it does not test the reversing 
valve solenoid.<br>For greatest efficiency and service life, we recommend regular maintenance by an HVAC contractor.

The water supply pressure is greater than 80 psi. Pressures above 80 psi
 may void warranties for some appliances such as water heaters or 
washing machines. Flexible supply lines to washing machines are more 
likely to burst with higher pressures. Typically the pressure cannot be 
regulated at the water meter. Recommend having a qualified plumber 
evaluate and make modifications to reduce the pressure below 80 psi. 
Installing a pressure reducing valve on the main service pipe is a 
common solution to this problem. If one exists, then it should be 
adjusted for lower pressures.

The clothes dryer is equipped with a vinyl or foil, accordion-type, 
flexible exhaust duct. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission 
considers these types of ducts to be unsafe, and a fire hazard. These 
types of ducts can trap lint and are susceptible to kinks or crushing, 
which can greatly reduce the air flow. This duct should be replaced with
 a rigid or corrugated semi-rigid metal duct, and by a qualified 
contractor if necessary. Most clothes dryer manufacturers specify the 
use of a rigid or corrugated semi-rigid metal duct. For more information

One or more electric receptacles that serve countertop surfaces or are 
within six feet of a sink appear to have no ground fault circuit 
interrupter (GFCI) protection. This is a safety hazard due to the risk

<span class="r12g"><b>Conclusion: </b>We have inspected the major 
structural components, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems
 and other areas of this property<br>for signs of significant non-performance, excessive or unusual wear and general state of repair.<br>When
 we recommend repairs to or replacement of a component, we recommend the
 determination of appropriate corrective action be left to the 
professionals retained for the detailed evaluation and repair.<br>Lower priority conditions that are neglected may become higher priority <br>concerns in the near future. Cost should not be the primary motivation for performing repairs.<br><br>While
 we make every effort to identify existing as well as potential 
problems, it is not possible for anyone to predict future performance of
 all the systems and appliances in a building. For this reason, we 
suggest budgeting annually for unforeseen repairs and/or the purchase of
 a comprehensive home warranty policy.</span><br><span class="r12g"><b>Final Walk: </b>As
 a closing comment to our valuable clients, please remember that your 
inspection was an examination of the property at a specific point in 
time. The real estate transaction process can be a lengthy procedure 
from the time of inspection until the close of escrow. For the most part
 the home may be occupied at the time of inspection, and many areas may 
be blocked with owner storage. The final walk is your opportunity to 
verify that any requested repairs have been made correctly ( as 
evidenced by appropriate invoices from licensed contractors ) that any 
areas blocked from the visual inspection such as garage floors and 
sidewalls, storage closets etc. which should now be cleared, do not show
 any defects ( damaged walls, moisture stains etc. ) which may have been
 hidden at the time of the original inspection. <br>This is also the 
time to make sure that any owners manuals, remote control devices, 
special keys or warranty paperwork has been left at the house. It is 
also prudent to verify that permanent fixtures have not been damaged or 
removed. That new damage has not occurred such as broken glass, overly 
stained carpets, inoperable appliances etc.<br>It is also recommended to
 have the homeowner demonstrate auxiliary systems such as built-in 
vacuums, irrigation, security, surround sound for proper operation.<br><br>Should there be any questions about the home inspection report, please contact: Gary  Swinteck  at 480-628-5220</span><a name="ap"></a>
