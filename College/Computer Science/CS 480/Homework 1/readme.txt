This program was compiled using gcc on cygwin.  The code should work in full on a linux server.  use the ./a.exe to start it.  Or in windows double click the exe file.  You will notice the prompt that comes up.  I tested it by launching the a.exe from within the program.  You will notic other commands work also, and ending a command with the & sign doesn't wait for the command to finish.
