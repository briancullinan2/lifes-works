distributed system
no common plugs, dock
no shared memory
geographic 

motivation for DS
load distribution
performance boost
bridge distance
Resource access
Reliability
Scalability

Parallel systems
multiprocessor - uniform memory access
	Direct access to shared memory, interconnected by a bus
	UMA - uniform memory access
multicomputer - no direct access to shared memory
	work on own private memory
	NUMA - non-uniform memory access
Array processors
	tightly coupled machines

Challenges
hide policies, mechanisms
transparency
	access, location - network transparency
		implement mechanism that allow access to different kinds of resources with the same kind of primitives and mechanisms
		don't care where resources are
	migration
		move things around for the user nothing changes
	replication
		duplicating and synchronizing
	concurring
		keeping data synchronized without user noticing
	failure
		when something fails something else takes over with not noticing it
	performance
		load changes without affecting the user
	mobility
		computers like mobile laptops reporting to different stations
	scaling
		add more resources


Fault tolerance

A distrubuted system
	does not share global memory
	does not share global clock but can query a global clock server
