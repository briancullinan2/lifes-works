Things don't cast the way we want.

double d = 1.733
unsigned long long e;

e = d;
e = (unsigned long long) d;
// e will be equal to 1
// it does a cast

so we could do

e = *(unsigned long long*) (&d)

our first assignment is about this.

signed is arithmatic
unsigned is logical

logical vs arithmatic bit shifting

t = 010010111;
all of these could represent flags

mask = 1;
to set a mask
t | mask <-- sets
t & !mask
t ^ mask <- toogles the bit

#define CHARGE_FLAG 1


Structs

struct NAME {
 int i ;
 int y ;
} MYSTRUCT_INSTANCE_NAME;

(must include keyword struct in name)

typedef struct NAME_T {
  struct NAME_T wow; 

} NAME;

crazy

// all uses same stuff in memory
union {
 double d;
 unsigned long long e;
}

if we say d=1.73, then e contains it now as well

point x
x.d=5.3;
x.e=17;

point* x;
x = (point *) malloc(sizeof(point));

x->d = s.3;
or 
(*x).d = 5.3;

const int x = 7;

// always reads from memory, not from a register
volatile int y;


had to navigate to the drivers/windowsxp to find the driver for the stick
