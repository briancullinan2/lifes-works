C Features
=============
* type -unsafe
* memory -unsafe, casting, pointer arithmetic
* no garbage collection
* undefined behavior
	overflowing integers
	outside array access
	not returning a value from a non-void function

* allows goto + jumps

* undefined lib behavior fflush();

libc -> 
std library ->
word size of the architecture

Types:
int8_t signed char
-128 --- 127
int16_t short
int32_t long 
int64_t long long


uint8_t signed char
-128 --- 127
uint16_t short
uint32_t long 
uint64_t long long


Pointers;
char s = "a";
long * t = &s;
long s[2] = {42, 100}
s[0] <- 42
*s
*s 
t = s;
* ( t + sizeOf(long)) <-- doesnt quite work.

t = t << 1
t <- 


arithmetic shift vs logical shift, have to cast to unsigned longs & the like
