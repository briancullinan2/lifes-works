Lookup what these clocks are for.

ACLK -> 2, supposed to be 32 KHZ (but ours is a VLO, 2KHZ-16KHZ) 12ish
SMCLK -> 6,  subsystem master clock, 1.1 MHZ
TClk -> 8
SCLK -> 7

P1DIR = BIT3; (Bin 1000);
P1SEL = BIT3; (Bin 1000);

cant be done with smclk, we cant send a byte every clock signal

could use the aclk

P1DIR =1;
P1SEL = 1;

setup a timer (with 1) or interrupt on the clock itself, 


What is the BEST WAY TO DRIVE IT.

flip whenever we want the clock to tick.

Have to look up how fast on the datasheet the shift register can go.

Serial out from our processor
serial to parallel CHIP
sn54hc595

need another clock to run the LCD.
