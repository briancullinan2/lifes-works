<h3><strong>West African Slave Trade </strong></h3>
 <p>Who was a slave? In West Africa, you could be enslaved to pay a 
family debt or obligation owed to those more powerful. You may have been
 born into slavery and have known nothing but that life. By far, though,
 people were most often enslaved when they were defeated in battle by a 
stronger group.</p>
West Africans, Europeans, and Arabs were all involved in the slave 
trade. As Europeans built coastal fortification as footholds on the 
African continent, power began to shift to the coasts from the 
traditional groups and trade routes that ran up and down the interior. 
Slave markets developed around these ports as humans became the cargo of
 choice.
<p><img src="roots.C.2.a_files/slave_fort.jpg" alt="slave fort" 
height="232" width="350"></p>
So many West Africans died during transport from African coastal ports 
to the Caribbean—which was called the 'middle passage'—that nearly one 
in seven did not survive the voyage. The mortality rate was nearly 25% 
in the earlier decades of the slave trade mostly due to cholera and 
dysentery. However, British slave ships' crews died during the same 
passages at a rate of 17%, so life was not so good above decks.
<p>West African slaves were brought to Cuba or Jamaica for 'seasoning' 
(yes, the expression was the same that was used for meat) during which 
time they were acclimatized and suffered further island diseases such as
 dysentery, smallpox, and lockjaw. Most West African slaves remained in 
the Caribbean or shipped to Central America to work the huge sugar 
plantations <strong>(<a

 2002</a>).</strong></p>
 <p><img src="roots.C.2.a_files/slaves_belowdeck.jpg" alt="salves being 
shipped" align="left" height="274" width="350">Fewer West African slaves
 were shipped north to New Orleans for further sale to American 
agricultural landholders. The plantations of the American South were far
 smaller than the vast agricultural enterprises of the Caribbean or 
Central America where many slaves were left to themselves after the 
day's work ended. As a consequence, many were able to preserve cultural 
practices that they brought with them from West Africa.</p>
 In the American South, supervision by the slaveholder was omnipresent. 
West African religious observance, music making, and other cultural 
practices were actively suppressed. The very strong West African 
cultural legacy that survived in the Caribbean and parts of Central 
America was modified in America as it mixed with European cultural 
practices like religious worship and music making. Spirituals and Gospel
 music are two such examples that would have an influence on the later 
development of jazz.
