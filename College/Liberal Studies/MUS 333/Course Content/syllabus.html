<p>There will be a variety of levels of reading that students critically
 engage throughout the course including the course text written by the 
instructors, secondary journal and reference articles written for the 
profession, and primary source readings. In course Exams and the Written
 Assignments, critical thinking and critical reading will be 
demonstrated through engagement with the above activities.</p>
<p><strong>Student learning outcomes </strong><br>
  Successful students in this course should be able to discuss and 
demonstrate for assessment how and why people historically construct, 
socially maintain, and individually create and experience jazz (valuing 
the human experience, critical reading, critical thinking).</p>

  ALL LISTENING and VIDEO EXCERPTS, PHOTOGRAPHS, INTERVIEWS, and OTHER 
MATERIALS used in this course are PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT. </p>
<p><strong>Any attempt to capture copies of the above is a violation of 
copyright law</strong>. In accordance with the “Technology, Education 
and Copyright Harmonization Act” (TEACH Act) of 2002, this course </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>limits      access of copyrighted works to students currently

</ul>
<p><strong>III. Assessment </strong><br>
Achievement of course objectives will be accomplished through graded and
 ungraded assessments.</p>
<p><strong><u>Examinations </u></strong><br>
  All sections of this course will utilize graded Examinations for 
assessment. Examinations will consist of multiple-choice, true-false, 
and identification questions that are designed to assess students’ 
ability to apply concepts learned in class (valuing the diversity of 
human experience, critical thinking, and critical reading). </p>
<p>All Examinations will be taken online within the course (see 
Examination Schedule below). Students will receive a score immediately 
upon the completion and submission of each Exam. Please read and 
carefully follow ALL Examinations instructions.</p>
<p>As you go through the course, Exam questions will increasingly focus 
on listening and refer to audio excerpts. Audio excerpts and Exam 
questions may deal with material discussed or listened to in the course,
 or something that is either similar or dissimilar in important ways to 
material discussed or listened to in the course. It will be impossible 
to cover every item with an Exam question. Examinations are based on the
 integration of all learning components.</p>
<p>There will be three (3) Exams that each covers material from a 
section of the course. There will also be one (1) Comprehensive 
Examination that covers material from the complete course.</p>
<p><strong>Examination schedule </strong><br>
  Click on the COURSE CONTENT for detailed course contents.</p>
<p><strong>Exam 1</strong> will cover material from the 'Introduction' 
section through the end of '<a

 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">Roots</a> of Jazz.'<br>
    <strong>Exam 2</strong> will cover material from the 'Cut 'n' <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113994071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">Mix</a> to Re-mix' section through
 the end of <br>
    <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </strong>' Modal and Free Jazz.' <br>
    <strong>Exam 3</strong> will cover material from the 'Birth of the 
Cool' section through the end of 'Dixieland.' <br>
    <strong>Comprehensive Exam </strong>will cover material from the 
complete course. </p>
<p>All Exams are hyperlinked at the appropriate point in the course text
 and may be found by clicking on ‘Assessments.’ </p>
<p><strong>Examination due dates </strong><br>
  All Exams are DUE by <strong>Friday, May 7, 2010, by 11:00 PM</strong>.<br>
  NO late submissions will be accepted.</p>
<p>Any Examination not completed by the due date will receive a grade of
 ZERO (F). </p>
<p><strong><u>Written Assignments </u></strong><br>
Please read the instructions for completing the Outline &amp; Thesis 
Statement, Draft Paper and Final Paper by clicking on ‘Assignment’ in 
the course and then again on any of the three listed assignments. </p>
<p>You will read the assigned Article and, based on the Paper Topic, 
submit an Outline with Thesis Statement (50 points possible), a Draft 
Paper (100 points possible), and a Final Paper (150 points possible) for
 grading by the due dates (for a possible total of 300 points).&nbsp;You
 will receive feedback from your Teaching Assistant (TA) for each of the
 above activities (Outline, Draft, and Final Papers). </p>
<p>You are expected to develop each of your graded activities from the 
Outline through the Draft Paper to the Final Paper based on the Paper 
Topic and feedback provided through a Grading Rubric and Comments from 
your Teaching Assistant (TA). </p>
<p>All articles, assignments, and supporting documents are at the bottom
 of the page under the ‘Attachment’ heading in the appropriate 
assignment (such as ‘Draft Paper’) by clicking on ‘Assignment.’</p>
<p><strong>Paper topic</strong><br>
  Please read the interview from a 1985 issue of Musician magazine with 
jazz greats Herbie Hancock and Wynton Marsalis, titled “Soul, Craft, and
 Cultural Heirarchy” by editor Robert Walser.</p>
<p>As you read through the interview, you will find an increasing 
divergence in fundamental assumptions between Hancock and Marsalis. BE 
WARNED—you will encounter strong language, imagery, and ideas with which
 you may agree or disagree. Please also read through the brief 
introduction to the article written by Rob Walser, the Chair of the 
Ethnomusicology Department at the University of California at Los 
Angeles, which puts the article and the two musicians into context. At 
root, the issues that Hancock and Marsalis discuss can be applied to 
earlier jazz as well—just the particulars would change. Of the many 
ideas discussed between Hancock and Marsalis, select one idea that you 
find interesting on one side or the other of the argument to be used as 
the focus of your paper. Please back up your assertions with course 
materials and/or your own research. As you begin your paper, you may 
want to focus on the jazz you have studied in the course to date. 
However, you may want to enlarge you focus in a later draft to include 
other jazz styles. That will be up to you. </p>
<p>You must cite references to any materials drawn from beyond this 
course (you do not need to cite course materials). Use any citation 
system that you are familiar with (Chicago Manual, MLA, etc.).&nbsp; Be 
consistent, though, in whatever system you do choose. Although based on 
your reading of the assigned article, good papers usually focus on one 
aspect of your overall interaction and thought process. You need to 
actively shape material from the article: that is, be strong and clear 
in your statements about and insights into the arguments presented in 
the article, then utilize the arguments presented in the article to help
 you develop your ideas. Focus and develop your discussion; do not just 
recount the article. Remember that there are many ways to discuss the 
issues raised in the article; therefore, you must be sure to explain and
 detail how you see things and why. Do not feel as if you need to 
discuss the entire article to write a good paper. Be careful of simply 
summarizing issues in the article. Be explicit and explanatory.</p>
<p>Paper Grading <br>
  Your TA will provide feedback via a Grading Rubric in the 'Comment' 
window and will provide a grade in the Comment box. You may be asked by 
your TA to further develop and resubmit a revised Outline, Draft Paper, 
or Final Paper to fulfill the requirement. In some cases you may be 
asked to revise and resubmit more than once. If you are asked to do so, 
do not worry. It is an opportunity to improve your work before a grade 
is issued.</p>
<p>Any graded activity not completed and submitted by the due dates will
 be given a grade of ZERO (0). Failure to revise and resubmit as 
requested by your TA will result in a grade of ZERO (0) for that 
activity.<br>
  To find your TA’s comments on the graded assignment, click on 
‘Assignment’ under the course menu, then click on the ‘Graded’ button to
 choose the appropriate assignment. If your assignment has been graded, 
you will see your TA’s comments listed in the right side of the 
page.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Paper grading rubric</strong><br>
  Below is the rubric that will be used to assess each of your Outline, 
Draft, and Final Papers.</p>
<p>Clarity of purpose. topic, and theme (25% of overall grade for each 
Draft or Final Paper)<br>
  It should be clear to your reader (your TA) specifically what you are 
discussing.&nbsp;Analytical writing should be explicit and 
focused.&nbsp;Be wary of having only a general sense of what you want to
 discuss or of developing two different themes in your paper. Some 
sentence early in the paper should offer your major, overriding insight 
(your Thesis Statement)—the point around which the whole paper adheres. </p>
<p>Substantiation (25%)<br>
  There should be a clear and definite sense of how the ideas in the 
paper originated in and developed from your interaction with the 
specifics of the article under consideration. This requirement helps you
 clarify your insights and helps someone else, like your TA, see your 
perspective more clearly. Substantiation can take the <u><a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113978071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">form</a></u> of referring to 
specific details, conflicts, resolutions, images, and/or using 
quotations to verify your points.</p>
<p>Coherence (20%)<br>
  All sections/paragraphs of your paper should help develop the 
topic/theme. Coherence means that there exists a unity of purpose and 
focus throughout the paper; that you do not meander to some other 
interest and that you do not lose track of the specific theme of your 
paper.</p>
<p>Cohesiveness (20%)<br>
  There should also be a sense of connection between paragraphs, some 
feeling of transition from one paragraph to the next—a developmental 
progression that builds throughout the paper. Some relationship should 
exist between the paragraphs in terms of how they forward or continue 
the discussion of your theme/topic.</p>
<p>Grammar/language/expression (10%)<br>
  The way in which you form your sentences, your use of the English 
language, and the way you express your ideas are also taken into 
consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion Groups</strong><br>
  Participation in the collaborative work of your Discussion Group will 
facilitate the achievement of course objectives. </p>
<p>You will be assigned to a Discussion Group.&nbsp; Please immediately 
check in with your Group and begin work on Discussion 1.<br>
  You will submit five (5) Discussion postings and ten (10) Responses 
for grading over the semester to other student Discussion postings in 
your Group on assigned topics in reaction to the assigned Discussion 
Topics. You are expected develop a critical stance in reaction to the 
Discussion Topic (critical reading and critical thinking). Please see 
the Topic for each Discussion posting for details. <br>
  For EACH of the five Discussions assignments, you will need to post in
 your Discussion Group within the ‘Discussions’ area <br>
  1. a minimum of one (1) two paragraph Discussion Posting based upon 
the assigned topic and 2. two (2) one paragraph Responses to other 
student’s Discussion Postings in your Discussion Group. <br>
  Remember that, while Discussions are open only to the other students 
assigned to your Group, it is still a public forum. </p>
<p><strong>Discussions schedule</strong><br>
  See Discussion due dates below.<strong></strong><br>
  <strong>Discussion 1</strong> You will introduce yourself.<br>
  <strong>Discussion 2</strong> Will cover material from the 
'Introduction' through 'Roots of jazz.'<br>
  <strong>Discussion 3</strong> Will cover material from the 'Cut 'n' 
Mix to <a

 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">Remix</a>' section through the end
 of 'Birth of the Cool'<br>
  <strong>Discussion 4</strong> Will cover all material from 'Bebop'
