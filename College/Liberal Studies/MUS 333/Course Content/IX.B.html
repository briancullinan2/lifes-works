<h3><strong> Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five </strong><strong></strong></h3>
<p> Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five’s 1928 recording of “West End 
Blues” contains one of the most inventive cornet solos ever recorded and
 we also hear Dixieland turning into something else. This is a great 
recording in which to hear elements that will point the way and be an 
open door into the new style called Swing. </p>
<p> Armstrong, here, was recording with a new group in Chicago . His Hot
 Five
  and Hot Seven were some of the very top Dixieland performers on the 
scene.
  Many were band leaders in their own right. This was a studio band—they
  rarely performed in public and came together only to record. 
Armstrong’s
  Hot Five featured Armstrong on trumpet and vocals, Fred Robinson on 
trombone,
  Jimmy Strong on clarinet, Earl ‘Fatha’ Hines on piano, Mancy Cara
  on banjo, and drummer Zutty Singleton. </p>
<p> “West End Blues,” composed by Joe Oliver and Clarence Williams,
  is a straight-ahead 12 bar blues. In each <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113953071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">chorus</a>, you will hear three 
musical
  phrases. Review 12 bar blues in the 


‘Basic Materials of Music’ <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113982071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">section</a> of the course, if you 
need a refresher. </p>
<p> Some things to pay particular attention to in “West End Blues” as 
you listen.</p>
<p><strong> Introduction </strong></p>
<p> Armstrong opens will a brilliant call that immediately catches your 
attention. It rises up to the top of the horn and then descends mixing 
many different rhythms in a 


stunning

<a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113994071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">mix</a>.</p>
<p><strong> 1st Chorus </strong></p>
<p> In the next section of the course, you will hear and we will discuss
 Dixieland style. One of its hallmarks is that all <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113956071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">melody</a> instruments (trumpet or
 cornet, clarinet, and trombone) are improvising together at the same 
time and their <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113976071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">improvisation</a> is of equal 
weight (no one is more important). 


In this 1st Chorus, though, who is playing the lead? Does one 
instrumental line dominate?

What instrument are your ears immediately attracted to? This focus on a 
single <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113970071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">soloist</a> (or section) within an
 ensemble part of the piece will become a hallmark of Swing.</p>
<p><strong> 4th Chorus </strong></p>
<p> It is in the 4th Chorus that we hear, in a single moment, Dixieland 
changing into Swing. The great pianist Earl ‘Fatha’ Hines is on this 
recording session. </p>
<p>Read the article <a 
href="http://libproxy.nau.edu:2048/login?url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/shared/views/article.html?section=jazz.202500&amp;subview=article_text"
 target="_blank">Earl Hines.</a></p>
<p> In "West End Blues," Hines begins by changing typical 
Ragtime-influenced Dixieland piano style (two beat, highly <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113936071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">syncopated</a>, duple 
subdivisions) by sounding a cascade of rapidly flowing notes that 
overruns the expected syncopations in the right hand. He returns to 
Dixieland tradition by playing a two-beat ‘oompah’ style in the left 
hand (<a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113995071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">bass line</a>). However, he 
immediately begins to flatten and smooth out the bass line into four 
undifferentiated beats of a walking bass line. For a moment we have move
 somewhere beyond Dixieland and into the new style that will be called 
Swing.</p>
<p><strong> 5th Chorus </strong></p>
<p>  This is one of the most famous solos in all of jazz. Armstrong 
builds an amazing amount of tension and energy by simply playing one <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113989071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">pitch</a>! He coils things up on 
the single note through the first phrase of the <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113978071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">form</a> and it takes the next two
 phases for that energy to uncoil, descend, and dissipate. All the 
while, he is playing duplets, triplets, quadruplets, quintuplets and 
other non-duple divisions of the beat that was not that commonly heard 
in jazz at that time. Armstrong was a huge fan of Italian opera, which 
was popular music in the nineteenth through early twentieth centuries, 
and he heard a lot of great performances in his native New Orleans . 
Some have argued that Armstrong brought more complicated musical 
strategies and gestures from Italian opera singing into jazz and adapted
 it to terrific effect.</p>
