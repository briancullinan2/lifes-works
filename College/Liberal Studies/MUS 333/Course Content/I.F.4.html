<h3>Technology Shaping the Music</h3>
<p>  Recording has dramatically shaped what a performance is since the 
earliest
  days of this technology. </p>
<p><strong>Recordings</strong><br>
  From the 1920s, when A&amp;R men (artist and repertory agents) went 
scouring
  the cities and countryside of the East coast, Midwest, and some 
sections of
  the South, early non-electric recordings captured the sound of 
professional
  and itinerate musicians. There were originally no microphones and 
musicians
  had to gather near a large cone-shaped recording horn that captured 
their sound.
  Whatever made the loudest sound appeared as such on the 
recording—there
  was no way to <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113994071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">mix</a> the session other than to 
place louder instruments further
from the recording horn.</p>
<p>During these early recording sessions, a master record was cut in 
real time
  by a technician as the musicians performed and it was used to generate
 duplicates
  that were sold. The commercial records were molded from shellac (you 
can dissolve
  pieces of one of these records in a solvent and can create a shellac 
to use
  on wood). These shellac discs were played in people's homes on 
machines
  that basically reversed the process: a needle traced its way around 
the record
  in an analog reproduction of the musical performance, the needle was 
displaced
  side to side as it moved in the groove, and that displacement was 
amplified
  acoustically by the body of the record player (at first through a 
large horn
  in early models). </p>
<p>As the electric microphone was refined, it soon enabled a much more 
subtler
  process to develop in the recording session. Eventually with the 
advent of
  tape, which was a commercial bi-product of World War II, studio 
recording sessions
  were mixed down and multiple imputs from multiple microphones—one or
  even more to each performer in the session—enabled producers to 
increasingly
  shape the overall recording. Further, tape allowed for could multiple 
recordings
  or 'takes'of the same piece.</p>
<p>By the 1950s, recordings are frequently studio assemblages of various
 takes
  or live performances recorded in the studio. So we will encounter a 
variety
  of recordings in this course, from one-take complete performances as 
found
  in early jazz recordings through multiple edits, overdubs, and 
replacing whole
  sections or even notes of a single instrumental line in later jazz.</p>
<p>In this course, we will also experience jazz mostly through 
recordings (either
  sound recordings or video footage with sound). Recordings are frozen 
snapshots
  of sound in time. This means that we always need to remember that a 
commercially-issued
  recording is fixed and unchanging.</p>
<p><strong>Radio</strong><br>
  By the 1930s, radio was giving the young recording business a run for 
its money.
    While starting off broadcasting live performances from the studio, 
by the
late 1940s radio was playing records spun by DJs almost without 
exception.</p>
<p><strong>Digital recording and the question of performance</strong><br>
  By the late 1980s, digital recording had become increasingly the 
method of
    choice for all record producers—from home production to the pro 
studios.
    Digital editing made it possible to <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113943071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">fine</a> tune studio takes unlike 
ever before:
    <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113989071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">pitch</a> variation in a vocal 
performance, nuances of instrumental performance—all
    can be adjusted, altered, tweaked, and processed to a remarkable 
degree.
    As a result, recordings are increasingly much more 'perfect' than
    what one can hear live. Rarely can performers working before live 
audiences
    match the level that they attain in the studio. Digital recordings 
have become
    so distant from <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113955071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">live performance</a> that a mixed 
and edited digital recording
    is virtually a 'sculpted' work created by the <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113981071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">producer</a> using
the artist's output as raw material.</p>
