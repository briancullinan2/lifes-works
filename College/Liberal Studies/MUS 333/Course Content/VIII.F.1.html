<p>Much of Goodman’s time in New York was spent working for leaders who 
functioned more as personalities than performers. Goodman believed that 
musicians, not entertainers, should build a band. Forming his own band 
in 1934, Goodman at first patterned his group after Glen Gray and his 
Casa Loma Orchestra, a jazz-oriented band popular with college audiences
 at the time. Soon after, Benny and his band were playing on the 
three-hour coast-to-coast radio program Let’s Dance alongside Kel 
Murray’s dance band and Xavier Cugat’s Latin band for a twenty-six week 
run.</p>
<p>At the start the band was basically a dance orchestra and only 
occasionally played a ‘hot’ tune or two. For this engagement, Goodman 
brought in arranger Fletcher Henderson to spice things up. Benny was not
 a fan of the music being played by the sweet bands and wanted to 
present music that was ‘hotter.’ The public, however, wasn’t ready for 
what the band had to offer. A nationwide tour followed Goodman’s 
engagement at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York and both were dismal 
failures. All of that changed when the Goodman band performed at the 
Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles. Whitney Balliett, jazz columnist for 
the New Yorker Magazine described it best.</p>
<p>In 1935, the clarinetist and bandleader Benny Goodman, aged just 
twenty-six, left New York with his fourteen-piece "swing" band and, 
traveling in a rag-tag group of cars, headed for the huge Palomar 
Ballroom in Los Angeles. It was not an easy trip. There were half a 
dozen dismal, sparsely attended one-nighters and three weeks at a dance 
hall in Denver, where the band was forced to play waltzes, tangos, and 
novelty numbers. On the opening night at the Palomar, the band played 
ballad numbers in the first set, and there was little response from the 
dancers. Then one of the musicians said, if they were going to bomb 
again they might as well do it in style. So Goodman called for his hot, 
often up-<a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113985071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">tempo</a> arrangements, many of 
them by the ingenious black bandleader and arranger Fletcher Henderson, 
and the kids stopped dancing, clustered around the bandstand, and began 
roaring. Before the weeks at the Palomar were over, it was clear that 
Goodman had suddenly made jazz—still a suspect and largely subliminal 
American folk music, despite the brilliant inventions during the 
previous decade of Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, 
and Duke Ellington—into a popular music (Balliett 2000).</p>
<p>The radio broadcasts from the Palomar were heard all over the United 
States. The success of Goodman and his band was assured. When Benny 
brought his band to the Paramount Ballroom in New York later that year, 
people were literally dancing in the aisles. His performances were sold 
out wherever he went. Swing music had taken the world of music by storm 
and Goodman led the way.</p>
<p>Benny’s virtuosity on the clarinet was unmatched. No one could play 
with such flawless technique and with such a beautiful sound. He 
surrounded himself with the best musicians he could find and gave no 
thought to their race. Goodman’s groups always maintained the highest 
standards of musicianship. His bands and combos were among the first to 
have black and white performers playing together in public.</p>
<p>Benny took great pleasure in featuring his sideman as soloists. 
Drummer Gene Krupa, pianist Teddy Wilson, and trumpet players Harry 
James and Ziggy Elman went on to <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113978071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">form</a> their own bands as a 
result of the exposure Goodman gave them. The fans adored them. Watch 
and listen to Benny and the band perform “Let me Off Uptown.” The 
all-star cast of this video includes vocalist Anita O’Day, trumpet 
player Roy Eldridge, and drummer Gene Krupa. </p>

 the Gene Krupa video.</a></strong></p>
<p>A highlight of a Goodman performance was the trio tunes he did with 
Krupa and Wilson. I have the feeling that by giving Wilson the lion’s 
share of the <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113929071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">solo</a> space that Goodman was 
letting his audience know that an African-American musician was 
deserving of the spotlight. Watch and listen to the Benny Goodman Trio 
play “Avalon” in a 1954 performance.</p>
