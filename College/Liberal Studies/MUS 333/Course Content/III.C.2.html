<h3><strong>Bitches Brew (1969-70) </strong></h3>
<p>Miles' landmark double-LP recording, Bitches Brew, really brought 
jazz <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113972071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">fusion</a> experiments to 
the forefront. The name of the album was said to be from a desert on a 
menu at Serendipity, a 
then-famous New York retaurant.</p>
<p>Teo Macero, Miles' <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113981071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">producer</a> and head recording 
engineer in the late 1960s, helped Miles <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113994071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">mix</a> 
down albums from long studio jams and live concert tapes. Bitches Brew, 
alone, was edited down 
from nine hours of studio tapes. Read about <strong> <a 
href="http://libproxy.nau.edu:2048/login?url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/shared/views/article.html?section=jazz.279800#jazz.279800"
 target="_blank">Teo Macero</a></strong>. </p>
<p>Even though two three-minute 45s were issued from the ten to 
twenty-minute pieces on 
Bitches Brew, this album—and In a Silent Way (1969) that preceded—it 
were much 
different than jazz recordings that came before them.</p>
<p>In Bitches Brew, listeners had to adjust to the fact that <strong> <a
 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113929071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">solo</a> <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113976071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">improvisation</a></strong> was not
 at the heart of these fusion works and could no
longer be considered the measure of quality for a jazz performance. The 
album
featured a great deal of repetition, like that found in <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113966071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">funk</a> grooves and in pop
music, and the <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113933071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">standard</a> musical forms used in
 jazz up to this time were discarded
and the influence of art or classical music can be heard on the many <strong>through
composed</strong> forms on the album.</p>
<p>While Bitches Brew was created as a collaborative effort by Miles' 
musicians
  performing  together in the studio, the mix created by Teo Macero 
created a
  remarkably new soundscape. "Sometimes you subtract, take away the <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113947071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">rhythm</a> and
  leave just the high sound," said 
Miles, "or take what you know belongs to somebody else and keep the 
feeling" (<a 
href="javascript:showPage(-1,%20-1,%20-1,%20'/mod3/Biblio.html',%20'WEBCT_NO_ANCHOR_VALUE',%20'3');">Szwed
2002,
 289-90</a>). Electronica pioneer 
Brian Eno said that Macero in Bitches Brew "did something that was 
extremely
modern,  something that you can only do on records, which is, he took 
the performance
to pieces,  spatially. Now, those things were done by a group of 
musicians in
a room, all sitting close to one  another . . . but they were all 
close-miked,
which meant that their sounds were quite separate  from one another. And
 when
Teo Macero mixed the record, he put them miles apart. So this is  very 
interesting
to listen to a music, where you have the conga player three streets down
 the
 road here, you have the trumpet player on a mountain over there, the 
guitar
player—you 
have to look through binoculars to see him, you know! Everybody is far 
away,
and so the  impression that you have immediately is not that you are in a
 little
place with a group of people  playing, but that you're on a huge plateau
 and
all of these things are going on sort of almost on  the horizon, I 
think. And
there's no attempt made by Teo Macero to make them connect with one  
another.
In fact, he deliberately disconnects them from one another" <strong>(<a 
href="javascript:showPage(-1,%20-1,%20-1,%20'/mod3/Biblio.html',%20'WEBCT_NO_ANCHOR_VALUE',%20'3');">Szwed
 2002, 298</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p>In particular, listen to the opening of the title track of Bitches 
Brew. It
  starts with bass vamps  that lead to electronic piano 'explosions.' 
Overtop
  of this Miles enters and plays with extended  and heavy use of an 
Echoplex
  that creates reverberation to the point that he virtually plays duets 
 with
  his own echoed sound. Miles even works in an allusion to the Columbia 
Record's
  hit 
"Spinning Wheel" by Blood, Sweat, and Tears (Columbia was his long-time
record label  and the one that released Bitches Brew). At 2:51 in 
"Bitches
Brew," another <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113973071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">vamp</a> 
kicks in and so on throughout the piece.</p>

<p>The album Bitches Brew was constructed with the help of Miles' 
regular Quintet that he 
performed with live and with whom he worked things out for the 
recording. However, for the 
album's sessions he doubled things up so that he had basically had a 
double Quintet (and 
sometimes more):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Miles Davis, trumpet </p>
  <p>Wayne Shorter, soprano sax and Benny Maupin, bass clarinet </p>
  <p>Chick Corea and Joe Zawinul, electric pianos; with Larry Young, 
electric piano </p>
  <p>John McLaughlin, electric guitar </p>
  <p>Dave Holland and Harvey Brooks, electric and acoustic bass </p>
  <p>Jack DeJohnette and Lenny White, drums; with Jumma Santos (Jim 
Riley) and Airto Moreira, 
percussion; and Charlie Alias, drums</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a remarkably talented group of younger jazz musicians. Miles 
was always able to spot 
and attract the best of quickly-rising talent. Chick Corea, who played 
keyboards with Miles from 
1968-70, was using an electronic piano on the Bitches Brew sessions and 
live with Miles' Quintet, 
rather than an acoustic piano. Corea further modified the sound with an 
Echoplex (echo 
generator) and a ring modulator (an early <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113978071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">form</a> of analog synthesizing). 
Chick, incidentally, 
thought that Bitchs Brew was merely a slower, more conservative version 
of the material that 
they performed regularly live with Miles' Quintet <strong>(<a 
href="javascript:showPage(-1,%20-1,%20-1,%20'/mod3/Biblio.html',%20'WEBCT_NO_ANCHOR_VALUE',%20'3');">Szwed
 
2002, 296</a>)</strong>. We will discuss Chick Corea, as well as 
guitarist John McLaughlin, in 
more detail later in this <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113982071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">section</a> of the course.</p>
<p>Austrian jazz composer and keyboardist Joe Zawinul, who played with 
Miles from the late 
1960s into the early 1970s, provided several compositions for the 
Bitches Brew sessions including 
"Pharaoh's Dance." </p>
<p>Zawinul's "Pharaoh's Dance" is a programmatic work, in that it was 
written to tell 
a story in music. "Pharaoh's Dance" refers to the building of the 
pyramids. "It 
begins in a busy, animated spirit, with separate instrumental lines 
staggering in one after 
another, overlapping, piling waves of sound on top of quietly bustling 
percussion," writes 
John Szwed, "while Benny Maupin's bass clarinet bubbles up from below" <strong>(<a

<p>Bassist Dave Holland played with Miles from 1968-70 and, on Bitches 
Brew, plays <strong> 
vamps</strong> relentlessly. "A lot of people went into shock when they 
heard the group,&amp;
quot; said Dave Holland, "because what we were doing with electronics 
just wasn't a 
familiar sound. It was like having someone talk to you in a foreign 
language" <strong>(<a

</p><p>Miles' Quintet drummer, Jack DeJohnette who was with Miles from 
1969-72, anchored the 
various drummers and percussionists on the Bitches Brew session. Miles 
said that he was in 
charge of the <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113991071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">rhythm section</a> because he was 
wearing sunglasses. Along with hard rock drummer 
Lenny White, DeJohnette was striking on every beat, rather than a more 
standard swinging style 
of drumming which even more evoked pop music in the sessions. Read about<strong>

 target="_blank">Jack DeJohnette</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Not only were the Bitches Brew sessions remarkable in their results, 
but the instruments that 
Miles' band members used was also setting a trend. Gone was the acoustic
 piano and it was 
replaced by two electronic pianos with early analog synthesizer 
modifications. Dave Holland's 
acoustic bass was supplemented by Harvey Brooks' Fender electric bass. 
(Brooks was a CBS 
record producer who also played on sessions for Bob Dylan and recorded 
with Electric Flag.) 
Wayne Shorter played soprano sax which could cut through the dense 
fabric of the ensemble or 
the electronics better than the lower-pitched alto or tenor sax. The use
 of two or more 
drummers, plus assorted percussionists, was also ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>Most of the pieces on Bitches Brew (1969-70) and its artistic 
predecessor, In a Silent Way 
(1969), were very focused on texture, or the 'weave' of sound. While 
Miles clearly directed and 
led things by his trumpet playing, the texture was generated more by the
 ensemble as a whole. 
So, the focus was on the ebb and flow of texture rather than the more 
standard focus of a <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113970071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">soloist</a> 
improvising with subsidiary accompaniment.</p>
<p>Listen to Miles' wonderful track <strong>"Shhh/Peaceful" from In a </strong><strong>
 Silent Way</strong><strong> (1969)</strong> that paved the way for 
Bitches Brew.

<p>As discussed earlier, many of the pieces on Bitches Brew were 
generated over vamps. Some 
were also no more than sketches by Miles of a few <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113937071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">chords</a> that he wanted to hear 
voiced by the 
various members of his band. While there is the flavor of funk or rock 
fused into In a Silent Way 
or Bitches Brew, they are really much more complex than any contemporary
 funk or rock 
recording. Also, Miles disregarded the funk and rock radio friendly 
three minute format by 
recording pieces that lasted from ten to twenty some minutes each.</p>
<p>In the Bitches Brew sessions, usually one of the pair (or more) of 
the drummers,
  pianists, or  bassists would lay down a groove and the other(s) would 
add to
  it or play in and around it. In "Bitches Brew," which you listened
  to earlier, there are also some fifteen edits in the  final mix. Some 
are tape
  loops created by Miles and Teo Macero that were used to extend and  
create
  vamps from small gestures that were recorded in the session, but then 
were
  extended in  the mixdown.</p>
<p>Miles performed "Miles Runs the Voodoo Down" often live with his 
Quintet, so it 
was fairly well formed when they took it into the studio. The title was 
added to the song by 
Columbia (and it is a title that Miles always hated).</p>
<p>Listen to <strong> Miles Davis, "Miles Runs the Voodoo Down"</strong>
