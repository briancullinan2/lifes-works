<h3><strong> Miles Davis </strong></h3>
<p>Miles Davis, who has been discussed in the Cut 'n' <a

 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">Mix</a>, <a

Jazz sections of this course, was also one of the most important 
contributors to the cool jazz style. During the mid '40's, he played and
 recorded with bop saxophonist Charlie Parker. While still playing and 
recording with Parker and feeling the need for a change of direction in 
his music, Miles put a 9-piece band (a nonet) together in the late '40's
 with another of cool jazz's important contributors, composer/arranger <a
 
href="http://libproxy.nau.edu:2048/login?url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/shared/views/article.html?section=jazz.142600&amp;subview=article_text"
 target="_blank">Gil Evans</a>. Their idea was to come up with music 
that embraced more refined, cerebral sensibilities that were not present
 in the freewheeling, highly charged bop style. </p>
<p>Evans, baritone saxophonist Gerry Mulligan, pianist John Lewis and 
John Carisi wrote the arrangements. The often lush harmonies, orchestral
 colors and contrapuntal lines (two or more melodies being played at the
 same time) found in the arrangements gave the impression of a small <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113954071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">big band</a> rather than that of a
 big small band or <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113921071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">combo</a>. The arrangements 
themselves took on as much importance as the solos creating almost 
seamless transitions from ensemble sections where all of the horns were 
playing to a <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113929071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">solo</a> and back again to the 
ensemble.</p>
<p>The nonet played its only live engagement for two weeks at the Roost 
in 1948. In 1949-50 the group recorded 11 songs at the Capitol Records 
Studio in New York . First released in the early '50's on 78 rpm records
 (which may account for the short length of the performances – 78's 
could only handle 3-4 minute of music per side), all 11 of the songs 
were released in 1957 on a 12" LP entitled <cite>The Birth of the Cool.</cite>
 The live engagement and the recording constituted the entire output of 
the band! </p>
<p> While not a big seller at the time, its effect on jazz musicians was
 profound. Cool jazz had matured into a viable style that others, 
especially on the West Coast, began to explore and are still exploring 
today.</p>
<p>Let's listen to a cut from <cite>The Birth of the Cool.</cite> 
"Boplicity", written by Miles Davis and arranged by Gil Evans. Evans was
 a master of combining advanced harmonies with a splendid ear for 
orchestration. The addition of a french horn and a tuba, instruments not
 usually found modern jazz bands, to the lineup of players and Evans' 
arrangement with its flowing lines creates a peaceful, relaxed feeling 
—i.e. Cool. The solos are low-keyed and devoid of fast, technical 
passages. The song is in an A-A-B-A <a

 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">form</a>, each <a

 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">section</a> 8 <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113941071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">measures</a> long.</p>
<p><strong><img src="V.B_files/Boplicity.gif" alt="Boplicity" 
height="642" width="600"></strong></p>
<p>By the way, do you remember what an A-A-B-A <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113935071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">song form</a> is? If not follow 
this breadcrumb trail starting from the <strong>MUS333 Homepage : Course
 Content &gt; Introduction &gt; How are people listening? &gt; Basic 
Materials of Music &gt; Song Form</strong>. The form of "Boplicity" fits
 perfectly into the A-A-B-A scheme both rhythmically and harmonically. 
Melodically, however, a couple of notes have been changed in the 2<sup>nd</sup>
 and 3<sup>rd</sup> A sections. While you are listening to the 
recording, have the music to "Boplicity" up on your screen. Compare 
measures 1 and 2 with measures 9 and 10. Now listen again and compare 
measures 7 and 8 with measures 31 and 32. You'll hear slight differences
 in the <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113956071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">melody</a>. If you aren't able to 
hear the differences, look at the music one more time and see that in 
measure 9 the notes go higher up on the staff and have a new <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113947071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">rhythm</a> pattern compared to 
measure 1. In measure 10 the 2<sup>nd</sup> note goes up rather than 
down as in measure 2. Measures 31 and 32 have a totally different rhythm
 pattern than measures 7 and 8. While the differences in the melody are 
slight, we want to be sure that you notice them.</p>
<p> Another thing to be aware of is that during the melody up until the 
baritone sax solo starts and the last eight measures of the recording 
the horns are in <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113963071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">rhythmic</a> unison. The notes 
each horn might be playing are not the same but the rhythm used in 
playing them is—rhythmic unison.</p>

<p>Before leaving "Boplicity" let's take another look at the printed 
music. You are probably wondering why punctuation marks and mathematical
 symbols appear in the music. What do dashes, dots and commas have to do
 with music making? Why do musicians pay attention to "greater than" 
(&gt;) symbols and to "is greater than or equal to" (≥) symbols? To 
musicians playing any style of music, these punctuation marks and math 
symbols have nothing to do with either English or Mathematics. These 
dashes, dots, and commas, are called "articulation marks" and tell the 
player how to play the note that one of them or a combination of them is
 attached to.</p>
<p> In measure 1 you'll se a dash above the third note. It's commonly 
called a "long mark" and it tells the player to play the note full 
value, in this case a quarter note (two eighth notes tied together). 
There is no audible space between it and the note that follows every 
time you see a dash – the notes are connected to one another.</p>
<p> The note that follows has a dot underneath it. The dot or "staccato 
mark" means that the note is played shorter than is printed – often half
 of its value. Here the quarter note sounds like an eighth note – half 
of a quarter is an eighth. Listen for a short but audible space between 
it and the next note every time you see a dot.</p>
<p> Take a look at measure 4 and find the comma above the staff before 
the last note. The comma is called a "breath mark." For every one in the
 band it means that the note just before the breath mark (comma) is to 
be played a bit shorter so that there is an audible space between it and
 the next note. (Probably for the wind instrument players (saxes, 
trumpets and trombones) it's a good place to take a breath, too!) The 
breath mark differs from the dot in that the note it follows is note 
played half of its value but just a tad shorter. As you listen to the 
recording listen for the space between the notes separated by a breath 
mark.</p>
<p> Measure 6 has the first of the math symbols in it – the greater than
 symbol (&gt;). To the musician this symbol is called an "accent mark." A
 note with an accent mark placed above or below it is given a little 
more emphasis, a slight increase in volume.</p>
<p> The math symbol over the last note in measure 17 (≥) is the "is 
greater than or equal to" symbol. To the musician it's a combination of 
two articulation marks – in this case an accent mark we just discussed 
along with a long mark talked about earlier. So we have a note that is 
emphasized and played full value.</p>
<p> Now go back and listen to the track one more time and pay particular
 attention to the articulation marks.</p>
<p>The Miles Davis and Gil Evans collaborations continued on well into 
the '50's with the 1957 release <cite>of Miles Ahead</cite>, 1958 
release of <cite>Porgy and Bess</cite> and the 1959 release of <cite>Sketches
 of Spain. </cite></p>
<p>Evans arranged the music from George Gershwin's Broadway show <cite>Porgy
 and Bess</cite> for Miles and big band. The arrangement of the song 
"Summertime" continues the cool feeling established with <cite>The Birth
 of the Cool</cite> recordings. Again you'll hear lush harmonies and 
orchestral colors heard in the earlier recording this time on a larger 
scale as the band playing behind Miles is much larger – twenty players 
compared to nine. Evans added French horns, a tuba and alto flutes to 
the saxes, trumpets and trombones normally found in a big band creating 
unusual, yet engaging sonorities. </p>
<p>After a straightforward, unadorned performance of the familiar 
melody, Davis plays three solo choruses accompanied by a light, 
unobtrusive band background. Miles is playing with a harmon mute 
throughout the recording. </p>
<p><strong><img src="V.B_files/Summertime.gif" alt="Summertime" 
height="540" width="600"> </strong></p>
<p>The top line of the music is the melody – what Miles played. The 
bottom line is the accompanying (or counter) melody the band played 
throughout the recording. </p>
