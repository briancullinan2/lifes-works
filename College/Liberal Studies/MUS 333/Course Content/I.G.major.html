<h3 align="left">Jazz Theory Basics</h3>

  <p>"What the heck is that guy playing? He played the song and then 
began playing all those notes. What's going on?"</p>
  <p>What's going on is called improvisation. All of "those notes" came
    from the chords (and the scales they come from) that were chosen by 
the composer
    to harmonize the song. Jazz music has improvisation at its heart. 
Improvising
    (i.e. creating new music on the spot) may also be described as 
spontaneous
    composition. With few exceptions, you've learned all of the chords 
and scales
    jazz players use to improvise in your theory classes. No kidding! 
The main
    difference between classical music theory and jazz music theory is 
that classical
    music theory is used to describe music that has already been written
 while
    jazz music theory is used to create new music. The materials are the
 same.
    An F chord in J.S. Bach's music is the same as an F chord in Miles 
Davis'
  music.</p>
  <p><em>The most important and widely used material in jazz 
improvisation comes from the major scale, its modes and chords.</em> I'm
 aware of the fact that most, if not all, college music theory programs 
discuss major scale modes for about 30 minutes total in all four 
semesters. The same was true when I took music theory sometime during 
the last century! This Jazz Theory Basics section is not designed to 
turn you into an improviser but to refresh your memory of those scales 
(modes) and chords and to help you to understand what chord symbols mean
 so that you have an idea as to what's going on in the jazz player's 
head.</p>
  <h3>Major modes and where they come from</h3>
  <p>Starting on each note of a major scale and playing up an 
octave—seven notes—resulting in seven modes (one mode per scale step) 
creates the modes of the major scale. Don't be confused by the fact that
 these new scales are called modes. Since the modes share the same notes
 in the same specific order as the major scale from which they are 
derived, it's clear that the modes are a specific group of inter-related
 or diatonic scales. In popular music, pop, jazz, etc, a mode is a 
scale, a scale is a mode.</p>
  <p>Each mode of the major scale—the major scale itself included—has a 
name attached to it. As the name "major scale" implies a specific set of
 whole and half steps, so to do the ancient Greek names that have been 
given to each mode of the major scale:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1st scale step – the Ionian mode</p>
    <p>2nd scale step - the Dorian mode</p>
    <p>3rd scale step - the Phrygian mode</p>
    <p>4th scale step - the Lydian mode </p>
    <p>5th scale step - the Mixolydian mode</p>
    <p>6th scale step - the Aeolian mode (aka the natural minor scale)</p>
    <p>7th scale step - the Locrian mode </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, using the notes of the C major scale you'll have C Ionian, D 
Dorian, E Phrygian, F Lydian, G Mixolydian, A Aeolian and B Locrian. 
Play them on your instrument.</p>
  <p>No matter which major key you are dealing with, the mode names, 
their scale steps, their tonic chords and their intervals above the root
 remain the same, giving each mode its own unique melodic and harmonic 
character. The modes of the major scale and the chords they produce 
provide all of the basic melodic (modes) and harmonic material (chords) 
used in every style of music—Pop, Jazz, Blues, Rock, etc. Every song you
 have ever played or will play includes major scale modes and chords. </p>
  <p>All the modes can and do exist as separate, unique scales out there
 in the world of harmony. Any of the modes can be used as the tonic 
scale for a song. For example, the Mixolydian mode serves as the basis 
for the blues while many famous jazz pieces – <em>So What</em> and <em>Impressions,</em>
 for example – have been built around the Dorian mode. Any mode may 
start with any note. Sounds silly, but lots of people think that the 
Dorian mode always begins with the note D! (The white keys!) For those 
of you that aren't aware of it, F Dorian and Ab Dorian modes exist and 
are even played!</p>
  <p>Before we can connect the modes to a set of chords we need to:</p>
  <p> <strong>Spell scales harmonically<em>!</em></strong></p>
  <p>As taught to us, a scale was considered a source of 
melody-horizontal. We
    learned to number scale steps 1-2-3-4-5-6-7 reading from the bottom 
of the
    scale to the top—<em>the melodic spelling</em>. The second scale 
step
    referred to as the "2nd", the third scale step the "3rd",
    the fourth scale step the "4th", and so on.</p>
  <p>Here's an example:</p>
  <p> <img src="I.G.major_files/01_Melodic_spelling.gif" alt="Melodic 
Spelling" height="86" width="600"></p>
  <p>To the jazz musician a scale (mode) is also a source of 
harmony-chords-the
    notes of a scale stacked up in thirds-vertical. We all know about 
scale steps
    1, 3, 5 and 7—they make up the tonic seventh chord or the "1" chord
    of the scale or mode. So, what about scale steps 2, 4 and 6? I, for 
one,
    have never heard of a ma2 chord or a mi4 chord. Here's how those 
notes are
    handled:</p>
  <p>When used in chords, scale step 2 functions as the 9th of the 
chord, scale step 4 as the 11th and scale step 6 as the 13th, t<em>he 
harmonic spelling!</em> The numbers now read like this: 1-3-5-7-9-11-13.</p>
  <p><img src="I.G.major_files/02_Harmonic_spelling.gif" alt="Harmonic 
Spelling" height="90" width="600"></p>
  <p>The numbers tell us exactly how any note of any scale functions in a
 chord—root, third, ninth, etc. If we re-arrange the scale into 
ascending numerical order (i.e. stacked in thirds–our new harmonic 
spelling) here's what we get—a 13th chord!</p>
  <p> <img src="I.G.major_files/03_13_chord.gif" alt="13th Cord" 
height="98" width="601"></p>
  <p> Jazz players deal with music both horizontally (the melody) and 
vertically
  (the harmony) at the same time! </p>
  <p>A bit of Jazz Speak: The diatonic chords in any key are referred to
 as the "one chord", the "two chord", the "three chord"' and so on. NOT 
the "first chord", the "second chord", and the "third chord".</p>
  <h3>Major mode and their chords</h3>
  <p>Major scale modes contain four types of 7th chords—the ma7, the 
mi7, the dominant7th and the mi7(b5) pronounced "minor seven flat five" 
(aka the ø7 – half-diminished). Like the ma7 chord, the quality of these
 diatonic chords is determined by the interval make-up of the modes from
 which they are derived. Remember that 7th chords are made up of the 
Root, 3rd, 5th (a triad) and 7th of the mode. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Ionian and Lydian modes - Major 7th chord

  </ol>
  <ol type="I">
    <li>1st scale step – the Ionian mode (Major scale)<br>
    <img src="I.G.major_files/04_Ionian_mode.gif" alt="1st scale step – 
the Ionian mode (Major scale)" height="91" width="600"><br>
    Its tonic chord is a ma7 or a ma6—for example: Cma7 and Cma6. Other 
possible chord symbols (using C as the root) are Cma9, Cma11 and Cma13.<br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li> 2nd scale step - the Dorian mode<br>
    <img src="I.G.major_files/05_Dorian_mode.gif" alt="2 nd scale step -
 the Dorian mode" height="84" width="600"><br>
The Dorian mode has two tonic chords that have very different sounds - 
the mi7
and the mi6—for example: Dmi7 and Dmi6. Other possible chord symbols 
(using D as the root) are Dmi9, Dmi11, Dmi6

and Dmi13.<br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li>3rd scale step - the Phrygian mode<br>
    <img src="I.G.major_files/06_Phrygian_mode.gif" alt="3rd scale step -
 the Phrygian mode" height="87" width="600"><br>
    The mi2 (b9) and the mi6 (b13) distinguish the Phrygian mode from 
the Dorian mode. Its tonic chord is a mi7. A more accurate description 
is: mi7(b9, b13)—kind of Spanish sounding.<br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li>4 th scale step - the Lydian mode (Remember the word "Lydian" 
implies that the 4 th scale step is raised one half step when compared 
to a major scale. (You’ll  need this information when we discuss the 
modes and chords that come from the melodic minor scale.)<br>
    <img src="I.G.major_files/07_Lydian_mode.gif" alt="4th scale step - 
the Lydian mode" height="102" width="600"><br>
    The + or #4(#11) found in this mode distinguishes it from the Ionian
 mode—the major scale. The tonic chord of the Lydian mode is the 
ma7(+11) but is often written ma7(b5)—for example: Fma7(+11) or 
Fma7(b5).<br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li>5th scale step - the Mixolydian mode<br>
    <img src="I.G.major_files/08_Mixolydian_mode.gif" alt="5th scale 
step - the Mixolydian mode" height="91" width="600"><br>
    The mi7 (b7) above the root distinguishes the Mixolydian mode from 
the Major scale. Its tonic chord is a dom7th—for example: G7. (Remember 
the word "dominant" implies that the 7 th scale step is lowered one half
 step when compared to a major scale. You'll need this information when 
we discuss the modes and chords that come from the melodic minor scale.)<br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li>6th scale step - the Aeolian mode (aka the natural


or pure

 minor scale)<br>
    <img src="I.G.major_files/09_Aeolian_mode.gif" alt="6th scale step -
 the Aeolian mode" height="91" width="600"><br>
    The Aeolian mode is also known as the "natural minor" scale. The 
mi6th (b13 or +5) distinguishes the Aeolian mode from the Dorian mode. 
Its tonic chord is the mi7 or mi7(b13) or mi7(+5)— Ami7, Ami7(b13) or 
Ami7(+5).<br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li>7th scale step - the Locrian mode <br>
    <img src="I.G.major_files/10_Locrian_mode.gif" alt="7th scale step -
 the Locrian mode" height="94" width="600"><br>
    The Locrian mode is unique among the major scale modes. It's the 
only major scale mode with a diminished tonic triad. In addition to the 
b3 interval that it shares with the Dorian, Phrygian and Aeolian modes, 
the Locrian mode contains a dim5 (b5) above its root. The mode, then, is
 ultra minor.

The most descriptive name for the Locrian mode is Classical music's name
 for the tonic 7th chord of the mode—half diminished. The mode is called
 half diminished because it has a mi7 above it's root rather than a dim7
 found in a (full) diminished scale. Many musicians call the Locrian 
mode the "half-diminished scale." The tonic chord for the Locrian mode 
is usually written as a mi7(b5)—Bmi7(b5). The "classical" way of writing
 the same chord, ø7 (pronounced "half-diminished")—Gø7—is often used. 
Both symbols mean the same thing.</li>

  <p>Major Scale Mode and 7th Chord Summary:</p>
  <p>(Remember that any letter with or without sharps or flats attached 
may precede any of these symbols.)</p>
  <p>Mode Scale type Chord symbols that call for each mode</p>
  <p>1. Ionian major ma7, &#8710;7, ma6, 6/9, ma9, ma11, ma13</p>
  <p>2. Dorian minor mi7, mi9, mi69, mi6, mi11, mi13</p>

  <p>NB. </p>
  <p>Some people use a &#8710; to signify a ma7 chord. Not too common, but you
 need to be aware of what the symbol means in case you come across it. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A +
    

    (plus) and a # (sharp)
    
 in parentheses mean the same thing—the note is raised one half step. In
 jazz speak, you would say "major seven sharp 11" (ma7(#11) or "major 
seven plus 11" (ma7(+11).</p>
    <p>A – (minus) and a b (flat)  in parentheses mean the same 
thing—the note is lowered one half step. In jazz speak, you would say 
"minor seven flat five" (mi7(-5) or (mi7(b5).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To help you to recognize these chord and scale pairs (known in jazz
 jargon as 


  <em> chord/scales</em>), I recommend that you practice playing them on
 the piano. Play the chord with your left hand and the mode (scale) with
 your right up and down a few times. For the scales and chords that 
follow– sounds you've probably never have heard before–it's imperative 
that you spend time at the piano. By the way, if you are adventurous 
enough to play the scale in thirds, fourths, fifths, sixths, or make up a
 melody using only the notes of the scale, you'll be improvising!</p>
  <h3>Other chord/scales (chord and scale

 pairs) commonly used in Jazz</h3>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>Melodic minor chord/scales:
      <p>Jazz musicians, contrary to classical music rules, play the 
melodic minor scale the same both up and down–the Jazz Melodic Minor 
scale. Remember that the jazz musician is improvising on both the scale 
AND the chord. The tonic chord of the melodic minor scale is a mi ma7 
(minor major seventh). If a jazz soloist has more than a couple of beats
 to play using this chord, upward and downward passages will have the 
same pitches in them to keep the integrity of the chord/scale intact. 
So, the chord/scale—the 1st mode of the jazz melodic minor scale—looks 
and sounds like this:</p>
      <p><img src="I.G.major_files/11_Jazz_Mel_Minor.gif" alt="1st mode 
of the jazz melodic minor scale" height="87" width="600"></p>
  <p>The second mode of the melodic minor scale and its chord is rarely 
used, so let's move on to modes 3-7.</p>
  <ol start="3" type="I">
    <li>3rd scale step - the Lydian Augmented scale<br>
      <img src="I.G.major_files/12_Lydian_Augmented.gif" alt="3rd scale 
step - the Lydian Augmented scale" height="86" width="600"><br>
    This scale is called Lydian augmented because it contains +4(+11) 
and ma7 intervals (like the Lydian mode) and, a +5 interval above the 
root (augmented). The tonic chord of the Lydian Augmented scale is the 
ma7(+5, +11) but is often written ma7(+4, +11).<br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li> 4th scale step – Lydian Dominant scale<br>
      <img src="I.G.major_files/13_Lydian_dominant.gif" alt="4th scale 
step – Lydian Dominant scale" height="101" width="600"><br>
    This scale is called Lydian Dominant because it contains ma3 and 
(+11) intervals (just like the Lydian mode) and, a mi7 interval above 
the root (just like the Mixolydian mode). It’s  used as a dominant 
chord/scale—aka, a "5" chord.<br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li> 5th scale step – Dominant b13<br>
      <img src="I.G.major_files/14_Dominant_b13.gif" alt="5th scale step
 – Dominant b13" height="86" width="600"><br>
    The dominant b13 scale is the second dominant scale that comes from 
the melodic minor scale. Except for the b13, it is identical to the 
Mixolydian mode. The dominant b13 scale is typically used for the "5" 
chord in minor progressions. Its tonic chord is written 7(b13)—G7(b13).<br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li>6th scale step – Locrian natural 9<br>
      <img src="I.G.major_files/15_Locrian_natural_9.gif" alt="6th scale
 step – Locrian natural 9" height="100" width="600"><br>
    The Locrian natural 9 scale is the second minor scale that comes 
from the melodic minor scale. Except for the natural 9, it is identical 
to the Locrian mode from the major scale. The Locrian natural 9 scale is
 typically used as a "2" chord in minor progressions. Its tonic chord is
 written mi9(b5) or ø9.<br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li>7th scale step – Altered scale (Super Locrian mode)<br>
    <img src="I.G.major_files/16_Altered_scale.gif" alt="7th scale step –
 Altered scale (Super Locrian mode)" height="97" width="600"><br>
    With a ma3 and a mi7 above the root, the Altered scale is a dominant
 scale. The Altered scale has in it every note of a dominant scale that 
can be changed while still retaining a dominant function. In addition to
 having a #11 in it, also contains altered 9's and no 13. Its tonic 
chord can take on many forms. Here re two: 7(+5, +9), 7Alt.<br>
    <br>
    </li>
</ol></li>
  <li>Harmonic minor chord/scale: 5th mode
    <p>The harmonic minor scale and the melodic min or scale share the 
same tonic chord – the mima7. Unless the melody of the song calls for 
the b13 found in the Harmonic minor scale, the melodic minor scale in 
normally used over a mima7 chord. The fifth mode of the harmonic minor 
scale, however, produces both a wonderful sound with the augmented 
second interval between the 2 nd and 3 rd scale step and its tonic chord
 – the 7(b9, b13) chord.<img 
src="I.G.major_files/16A_5th_mode_harmonic_minor.gif" alt="Harmonic 
minor chord/scale: 5th mode" height="86" width="600"></p>
  
  </li>
  <li>Symmetric chord/scales
    <p>Symmetric scales are scales in which the pattern of whole steps 
and half steps that make them up repeats over and over within the space 
of an octave. The three most common symmetric scales are constructed 
using alternating whole steps and half steps, alternating half steps and
 whole steps and all whole steps—no half steps at all.</p>
  <p>The first symmetric scale is made up of alternating whole steps and
 half steps. It produces a scale containing eight notes. It's called the
 Whole-half Diminished scale.<img 
src="I.G.major_files/17_whole_half.gif" alt="Whole-half Diminished 
scale" height="88" width="600"></p>
  <p>Its tonic chord is a dim7th—a diminished 7th chord not 
half-diminished. This scale has a fully diminished 7th chord in it—a 
diminished triad with a diminished 7th on top. The two other scales that
 have diminished triads in them, the Locrian mode from the major scale 
and the Locrian natural 9 from the melodic minor scale, both have minor 
7th intervals above their roots—half diminished 7th chords.</p>
  <p>The second symmetric scale is made up of alternating half steps and
 whole steps. It produces another eight note scale in which tonic chord 
is a dom7b9. It's called the Half-whole Diminished scale. It's known as 
the Octatonic scale in classical music circles.<img 
src="I.G.major_files/18_half_whole.gif" alt="Half-whole Diminished 
scale" height="87" width="600"></p>
  <p>With a ma3 and a mi7 above the root, the half-whole scale is a 
dominant scale —just like the Mixolydian mode. In addition to having a 
#11 in it, 


also contains two altered 9’s – a b9 (lowered) and a #9 (raised). To 
correctly describe the chord-scale relationship of this scale, one of 
the altered 9's must be included in the tonic chord. The most common 
chord symbols for this scale are 7(b9), 7(#9) and 7(b9, 13). If the 
melody calls for it, the #11 is added to the symbol – 7(b9, #11). In 
case the +11 is called a b5, the chord symbol would be 7(b5, b9).</p>
  <p>Did you notice that the notes found in the whole-half scale are, 
with a few enharmonic changes, the same as those found in the half-whole
 scale? One becomes a mode of the other. </p>
  <p>The third symmetric scale is made up entirely of whole steps. It 
produces a six-note scale whose tonic chord is the dom7(+5). It's known 
everywhere as the whole-tone scale. Another name for this scale is the 
augmented hexatonic scale!! Yoiks!!</p>
  <p><img src="I.G.major_files/19_whole_tone.gif" alt="whole-tone scale 
(augmented hexatonic scale)" height="91" width="600"></p>
  <p>The whole-tone scale is a dominant scale. It has a ma3 and a mi7 
above the root as do all other dominant scales. Like the Lydian dominant
 scale, the Altered scale, and the 8-note dominant scale, the whole-tone
 scale has a +11 in it. More importantly, the whole-tone scale has a +5 
it just like the Altered scale. The whole-tone scale is also like the 
Altered scale in that it does not have a 13th in the scale; the Lydian 
dominant and the 8-note dominant do. The only difference between the 
Altered and whole-tone scales is that the Altered scale, like the 8-note
 dominant scale, has altered ninths (b9, #9) in it while the whole-tone 
scale has a natural 9 in it; the Lydian dominant does too.</p></li></ol>
  <h3>Common chord progressions</h3>
  <p>Now that we are familiar with the building blocks of jazz 
improvisation, chord/scales, its time to put them together to make 
music. </p>
  <ol type="A"><li> The 2-5-1 Progression
    <p></p>
  <p>The most common chord progression in jazz is the 2-5-1. It's the 
progression that defines a key. In C major, for example, the 2-5-1 would
 be Dmi7 (Dorian) to G7 (Mixolydian) to Cma7 (Ionian).<img 
src="I.G.major_files/20_2-5-1_progression.gif" alt="2-5-1 Progression" 
height="89" width="500"></p>
  <p>Any mi7 or mi7(b5) can be used for the "2" chord. Any dominant 7 
chord may be used for the "5" chord. These chords may resolve to any 
minor or major chord. Here are a few examples:</p>
  <p> <img src="I.G.major_files/21_more_2-5-1_progressions.gif" 
alt="Progression" height="427" width="600"></p>
  <p>The 2 chord and the 5 chord may last anywhere from one beat to 
several measures each.</p></li>
  <li>The 1-6-2-5 Progression
    <p>In this progression, the 6 chord is usually changed from a mi7 
chord (Aeolian) to a dominant 7 chord (Mixolydian) setting up a 
secondary dominant relationship between the 6 chord and the 2 chord.</p>
  <p> <img src="I.G.major_files/22_1-6-2-5_progression.gif" alt="1-6-2-5
 Progression" height="81" width="600"></p>
  <p>The diagonal lines in each bar are called "slash marks." They 
indicate how many beats a chord is to be played. In the example above 
each chord is played for four beats. In the next example, the duration 
of each chord varies from bar to bar. In the second line you'll see 
rhythmic variations, too.</p>
  <p> <img src="I.G.major_files/23_slash_marks.gif" alt="Slash Marks" 
height="169" width="600"></p>
  <p>While these progressions are very common, bear in mind that in 
songs jazz musicians' play the chords can go anywhere harmonically. Keys
 can be changed in two beats!</p></li></ol>
  <h3>Song forms</h3>
  <p>Let's apply these chord/scales and common progressions to some 
songs commonly played by jazz musicians. With the exception of modal 
jazz tunes like <em>So What, Impressions and Milestones</em> (modal 
tunes with only two to four chords - no 2-5-1's), every song form we'll 
be looking at contains the 2-5-1 progression. </p>
  <p>In major 2-5-1 progressions the 2 chord is always a minor 7th 
chord, the 5 chord is always a dominant 7th chord and the 1 chord is 
always a major 7th chord. In minor 2-5-1 progressions the 2 chord is 
usually a mi7(b5) chord, the 5 chord could be a chord with altered 9's 
and 5's and the 1 chord could be a mi7th or a mima7th chord. </p>
  <ol>
    <li> 12-Bar Blues
  <p>The simplest blues progressions are usually played by blues and pop
 bands and go like this</p>
  <p><img src="I.G.major_files/24_Basic_blues.gif" alt="simplest blues 
progressions" height="168" width="600"></p>
  <p>Leave it to the jazz player to add the 2-5-1 progression to the 
12-bar blues to give it more harmonic interest: (Notice the 1-6-2-5 
progression in the last t4o bars.)</p>
  <p><img src="I.G.major_files/25_Jazz_blues.gif" alt="Progressions" 
height="167" width="600"></p>
  <p>In both progressions the 4 chord is played in measure 5 for 8 
beats, the 1 chord is played in measure 7, the turnaround back to the 1 
chord happens in measure 9 and the 1 chord is played in measure 11. No 
matter how simple or complex the blues progression is, measures 5, 7, 9 
and 11 are these target points are found in 99% of all jazz blues tunes.</p>
  <p>This next blues progression is jazz blues harmony taken to its 
extreme. Known as Charlie Parker changes, it has resolved and unresolved
 2-5 progressions all the way through. Here are the chord changes to the
 Parker <em>tune Blues for Alice: </em></p>
  <p> <img src="I.G.major_files/26_C.gif" alt="Charlie Parker changes" 
height="261" width="600"></p>
  <p>Charlie Parker liked to play these changes at metronome settings 
ranging from 240 to above 300 to the quarter note. Yoiks!! In spite of 
all of these chords the 4 chord is still played in measure 5, the 
turnaround back to the 1 chord still happens in measure 9 and the 1 
chord is still played in measure 11, just like the first two sets of 
changes—the same target points. The only difference from the standard 
set of changes is that the 3 chord is used as a substitute for the 1 
chord in measure 7. Many, many tunes have been written over blues 
progressions.</p></li>
  <li>Rhythm Changes and the A A B A song form
    <p>Rhythm changes, second in popularity with jazz musicians only to 
the blues, is the set of chord changes taken from the George Gershwin 
song I've Got Rhythm. It was first performed in the Broadway show Girl 
Crazy in 1930. The legendary tenor saxophone player, Coleman Hawkins, 
had this to say about the song: "<em>I've Got Rhythm</em> was an 
immediate hit with the jazz musicians of the 1930's. The changes were 
fun to play over; they could be altered, substituted for, bent this way 
and that, 


and <em>otherwise reshaped creatively.</em>"</p>
  <p>Like the 12-bar blues form, many jazz standards have been written 
over rhythm changes. It's not uncommon in jazz to find a melody or head 
based on the chord changes taken from another song. Some standard 
rhythm-changed based songs are 


Sonny Rollin’s <em>Oleo,</em> Miles Davis’ <em>The Theme</em> and 
Thelonious Monk’s <em>Rhythm–A–Ning</em>.</p>
  <p>The first set of rhythm changes is very similar to the original 
tune. The second set, with its more complex harmonies was developed as 
jazz musicians allowed the changes to be "otherwise reshaped 
creatively." Both sets are interchangeable during solos.</p>
  <p>Rhythm changes similar to the original <em>song I've Got Rhythm</em>.</p>
  <p> <img src="I.G.major_files/27_Rhythm_changes_basic.gif" alt="Rhythm
 changes" height="611" width="600"></p>
  <p>In the three repeats of letter A the only chord that is not 
diatonic to the key of Bb is the Ebmi chord on the 3rd beat of the 6th 
measure. Letter B, the bridge or channel, is a series of 5-1 
relationships: D (5) to G (1), G (5) to C (1), C (5) to F (1) and 
finally, F (5) back to the tonic Bb (1) for the last repeat of letter A.</p>
  <p>A more complex set of rhythm changes.</p>
  <p> <img src="I.G.major_files/28_Rhythm_changes_complex.gif" 
alt="Complex set of rhythm changes" height="611" width="600"></p>
  <p>In letter A, non-diatonic diminished 7th chords have been added on 
the 3rd beat of measures 1, 2 and 6. The 6 chord, Gmi7 has been changed 
to a G7 chord. The bridge, letter B, is now a set of unresolved 2-5's 
that finally resolve back to the tonic Bb for the last repeat of letter 
A. While more challenging to solo over, remember that any part of this 
set of rhythm changes is interchangeable with the first set</p></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Here are the changes to Charlie Parker's <em>Scrapple From The 
Apple</em>. We'll use then to point out the general characteristics of 
the A A B A song form:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> The A A B A form is usually 32 measures long.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li> The 1st ending usually has a turnaround in it that takes you 
back to the melody and the 1st chord of letter A.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>The 2nd ending is usually contains the tonic chord and may 
modulate to the key of the bridge. <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>The bridge, letter B, usually has a completely different melody 
and chords than letter A. Its last chord(s) usually modulates back to 
the melody and the 1st chord of the last letter A.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>The last A section usually ends with the tonic chord.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I've said <em>usually</em> for all five general characteristics as 
there are A A B A tunes out there that are longer than 32 bars. <em>Cherokee,</em>
 for example, is 64 bars long while other songs have their way with the 
standard progressions. All five general characteristics of the A A B A 
song form can be bent and "otherwise reshaped creatively."</p>

  <p>Here's <em>Alice in Wonderland,</em> the theme song from the movie 
of the same name. Which of the five general characteristics of the A A B
 A song form does it follow or not follow?</p>
  <p><img src="I.G.major_files/30_Alice_in_Wonderland.gif" alt="Alice in
 Wonderland" height="796" width="600"></p>
  <p>The A B A C song form</p>
  <p>General characteristics of the A B A C song form:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Are usually 32 measures long.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Have 3 different melody and harmony sections—A B and C.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Do not have a bridge. Letter B in this form is the 2nd 8 
measures of the song not the 3rd.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>The last chord(s) of letter B modulates back to the key of the 
melody and chords of letter A.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Letter C, the last 8 of the song, ends in the tonic key.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Remember that all these rules are meant to be broken in the same 
ways as the A A B A form!</p>
  <p>Let's check out <em>Green Dolphin Street 


  </em> – the theme song from the 1940’s movie of the same name. By the 
way, letter A is usually played with a Latin feel while letters B and C 
are played with a swing feel and the last 4 measures of the song are 
repeated over and over for an ending—or not.</p>
  <p> <img src="I.G.major_files/31_Green_Dolphin_Street.gif" alt="Green 
Dolphin Street" height="514" width="600"></p>
  <p>Here is another A B A C song <em>Someday My Prince Will Come</em> 
from the movie<em> Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em>. Jazz players 
can turn any song into a vehicle for improvisation!</p>

  <p>Other song forms</p>
  <p>While the 12-bar blues, the A A B A and the A B A C song forms are 
the most prevalent in jazz, many other song forms are also employed. 
Among them:</p>
  <p>A B C D - usually 32 measures long and has 4 sections each with 
different melodic and </p>
  <p>harmonic material—Harold Arlen's <em>Come Rain Or Come Shine</em> 
and Ray Henderson's <em>Bye Bye Blackbird.</em></p>
  <p>A A B C - usually longer than 32 measures long - letter C is new 
melodic and harmonic stuff different from letter A—Arthur Swartz's <em>Alone
 Together</em> (14-14-8-8 ) and Richard Rogers' <em>Where Or When</em> 
(10-10-5-12);</p>
  <p>A B - usually 16 measures long—Kenny Dorham's <em>Blue Bossa,</em> 
Sonny Rollins' <em>St. Thomas,</em> Tadd Dameron's <em>Lady Bird</em> 
and John Coltrane's <em>Giant Steps.</em></p>
  <p>A B C - has 3 distinct sections of melody and harmony—Wayne 
Shorter's <em>Miyako</em> and Joe Zawinul's <em>Mercy, Mercy, Mercy.</em></p>
  <p>A B A - has only 2 different sections of material—John Coltrane's <em>Like
 Sonny</em> Thelonious Monk's <em>Brilliant Corners.</em></p>
  <p>A A B - has 2 sets of material with letter A repeated—Cole Porter's
 <em>Night And Day</em> and Horace Silver's<em> Song For My Father.</em></p>
  <p>Song forms unique to a particular song—one off's—Bill Evans' <em>Blue
 And Green</em> (10 measures long); Chick Corea's <em>Windows </em>(48 
measures long, A B C D E), Monk's <em>Epistrophy</em> (24 measures long,
 A B A C), Horace Silver's <em>Barbara</em> (76 measures long, A B A C D
 E) and Cole Porter's <em>Begin The Beguine</em> (108 measures long(!), 
(A A B C D E).</p>
  <p>While this section in no way addresses all of the complexities and 
idiosyncrasies of improvised jazz music, it does serve to remind you of 
the theory you've had and how it can be applied to music in the present 
tense: music that is being invented on the spot


in any key and at any tempo. To the jazz musician, the theory and 
structure of songs is a language that is spoken through saxophones, 
pianos, trumpets and any other instrument you can think of. Jazz is an 
ever-changing, vital force that fills the void between the mundane and 
the apex of creativity. </p>
