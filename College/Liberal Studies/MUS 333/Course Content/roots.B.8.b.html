<h3>African 'Time' and <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113947071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">Rhythm</a></h3>
<p>West African music frequently features a steady, unchanging beat 
throughout a particular work. Sometimes this characteristic is called 
'metronomic,' after the mechanical device called a metronome used by 
Western musicians to keep a steady beat while practicing. This 
metronomic quality in West African music is no different than that found
 in American popular music, jazz, blues, rock, or many other kinds of 
music that either once, or continues to accompany dancing.</p>
<p>West African music, however, features a complexity of metric and <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113963071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">rhythmic</a> organization that is 
absent from most Western music. While some jazz styles, especially after
 the late 1950s and into the 1960s, developed a rather rhythmically 
complex interplay between drummers and other performers, most jazz and 
Western music still remains focused on a single pulse or beat within the
 ensemble. No matter how complex things get, there still is only a 
single beat ONE that everyone cues into. (That is not to say that some 
jazz musicians have not adopted and adapted some West African 
music-making strategies as a way to enrich their music making, a 
perceived return to <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113964071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">roots</a> traditions, or out of 
musical curiosity). The point being that jazz did not develop West 
African roots and musical procedures, but later sought them out and 
adopted them. As stated earlier in this course, it is a mistake to 
believe that African-American music was not fundamental to the formation
 and flourishing of jazz for more than a century. Yet, it is merely a 
conceit to believe that jazz was simply a further development of West 
African music making.</p>
Fundamentally, West African music is organized into a nexus or groups of
 shifting metrical relationships. To Western ears, there sounds like 
there is not a single 'time' going on in West African music. That is 
true enough, since there is not a single beat ONE that everyone cues 
into. But things are really different at a more fundamental level. For 
Western listeners and musicians, we organize sound by organizing time so
 that we can track sound and make sense of it as it moves though time. 
For West African musicians and listeners, there must always be at least 
two rhythms going simultaneously to organize sound. This, again, points 
up some fundamental differences between Western and West-African music 
making. In the West when we hear several <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113949071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">pitches</a> played together, we 
hear them as a unit (called a '<a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113922071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">chord</a>' or '<a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113968071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">harmony</a>'), but we have no 
language to describe specific rhythms, only the relationship between 
beats (either moving the beats as in quickening or slowing the <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113985071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">tempo</a> or rate of flow of the 
beats, or through accents in relationship to the beat as in 
syncopation). In West African music making, various rhythms (that flow 
from a number of different meters running simultaneously) come together 
to generate a 'beat.' So unlike the West where a beat organizes sound 
and is <strong> subdivided</strong>, in West African music the sound or 
various rhythms are assembled to generate a beat. So no one part carries
 the 'beat,' rather the ensemble generates the beat. It is only at this 
very high level of abstraction that one can begin to see some of the 
legacy of West African music making that may have survived in the group <a
 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113976071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">improvisation</a> of the early 
jazz style called Dixieland. (However, at root Dixieland never voiced 
anywhere near the rhythmic and metric complexity of even the most basic 
of West African drumming ensemble material).
