<h3><strong> </strong><strong> Bebop and swing: style characteristics</strong></h3>
<p> The swing <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113954071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">big band</a>, as we will discuss 
in more detail in the next <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113982071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">section</a> of the course, was 
quite large with up to twenty musicians performing together mostly 
reading pre-written arrangements that allowed little opportunity for <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113929071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">solo</a> <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113976071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">improvisation</a>. While there 
were a few great bebop big bands, like those lead by Billy Eckstein and 
Dizzy Gillespie, most of the action in bebop occurred within a quartet 
or quintet. </p>
<p>Bebop was ‘ear’ music, or music that was created to be listened to 
(like <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113977071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">art music</a>). Its tempos were 
often very fast and the <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113963071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">rhythmic</a> motion was frequently
 doubled so that either the rate that the <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113937071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">chords</a> and <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113956071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">melody</a> went by or the amount 
of rhythmic activity per second dramatically increased. Swing and 
earlier jazz was dance music that used moderate tempos that were good 
for dancing. </p>
<p>The <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113991071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">rhythm section</a> in swing 
outlined a four-beat pattern that was very stable and danceable. Bebop’s
 <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113947071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">rhythm</a> section created stacked
 layers of syncopation that created <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113934071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">polyrhythms</a> and polymeters, or
 the effect of multiple rhythms or meters played simultaneously. </p>
<p>Even different instruments were emphasized in the two style periods. 
Benny Goodman’s swing clarinet virtually disappeared in bebop (the bass 
clarinet would surface in some modal recording played most prominently 
by Eric Dolphy, but the clarinet has never come back to the level of 
prominence that it experienced in swing). In bebop, there is a focus on 
saxes and trumpet as solo instruments, with the electric guitar also 
gaining attention. </p>
<p>As mentioned before, swing musicians had little opportunity for solo 
improvisation in the complex arrangements played by swing big bands, 
while bebop <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113921071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">combo</a> performances were built 
exclusively around improvisation with a ‘tune’ sounded at the top and 
close of a piece that was often simply voiced by the soloists in unison.
 </p>
<p>Virtuosic display was a hallmark of bebop improvisation that was writ
 by being able to play technically challenging and rapid figures that 
were generated from many chromatic <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113922071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">chord</a> substitutions to an 
original <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113997071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">chord progression</a> in difficult
 or non-<a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113933071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">standard</a> keys. Bebop 
improvisers also used a number of musical ideas per solo break. Both 
later and earlier jazz styles usually focused on a single idea or two to
 develop into a solo passage. </p>
<p>Swing improvisation tended to be more like embellishing a popular 
song melody. This was a smart move for commercial music that was 
dependent upon consumers recognizing the original hit melody and 
following it throughout the improvisation. Bebop performers completely 
discarded the melody after an initial statement. This process gives rise
 to the modern concept of improvisation as truly composing and 
performing in the moment. </p>
<p>Even the type of tunes that were composed and used in performance 
differed between swing and bebop. Swing melodies were well-known (or 
soon to be) popular hit songs of the day that were usually simple and 
easy to understand at first listening (again, this was a smart strategy 
for music that was meant to be sold as a <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113938071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">commodity</a>). Bebop melodies, 
however, were much more complex, convoluted, and full of contrasts and 
surprises. </p>
<p>The harmonies used as chord sources for improvisation or as the basis
 for the arrangements in a swing big band piece were also relatively 
simple compared to what would be used by bebop musicians. Swing <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113968071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">harmony</a>, with the exception of
 the likes of Duke Ellington, was straight-forward material generated 
from the <a 
href="https://vista.nau.edu/webct/mediadb/viewEntryFrameset.jsp?id=34388113949071"
 class="glossarylink" target="_blank">pitches</a> of a particular 
diatonic scale. Chord progressions were usually simple triads (three 
note chords built from the pitches of a scale), seventh chords (four 
note chords), some augmented or diminished chords (chords that are 
stacks of all major thirds or minor thirds), and the occasional added 
sixth chord (C-E-G-Ab, or scale degrees 1-3-5-lowered 6, where the Ab is
 added to a C major triad as a lowered sixth scale degree in C major). </p>
<p>Bebop harmonies were much more complex and chromatic (introducing 
pitches from other scales), than swing harmony. Bebop harmonies extended
 traditional, swing-based harmonies by using more complex chords by 
stacking additional thirds to chords (creating ninth, eleventh, 
thirteenth chords) that were frequently also populated by chromatic 
borrowings from other scales. Further, bebop musicians often substituted
 more complex chords for simpler ones found in standard popular song 
chord progressions. </p>
<p>Swing used closed phrasing, where the melody, improvisation, or chord
 progressions all articulated or closed (cadenced) together in lockstep.
 With bebop, things were much more ambiguous and musicians cultivated a 
more open-ended and unresolved quality. There was a sense of whimsy to 
many bebop performances that were full of twists and turns and 
unexpected surprises. </p>
