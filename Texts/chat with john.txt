Today
[You]
so bored right now
trolling facebook
comment on my controversial status update so that it get's more attention
hows life?
[John R. Meyer]
haha
quite the troll post indeed
[You]
yeah! any thoughts?
[John R. Meyer]
i hate the rhetoric of the protests (99vs1), but our government is about as fucked up as it can get
[You]
i agree
[John R. Meyer]
the problem is a lack of regulation and the financial stranglehold corporations have over the govenment
which prevents meaningful regulation
and promotes greed and corruption
capitalism cannot function in a market without consequences
businesses have consolidated to such a degree that the market cannot control them on its own
[You]
but honestly, is protesting our government really going to help? NO. that's like trying to tell a dumbass they are stupid. or retailiating to road rage with road rage. they aren't going to magically learn their lesson and change. you have to change. and this conversation should be on the post.
[John R. Meyer]
an informed consumer body cannot "vote with their wallets" and boycott
[You]
yeah, that's true. i think a lot of companies have gotten too big and powerful. and what's to blame? patent laws.
[John R. Meyer]
the only solution is strict government regulation and a removal of corporate money from all levels of govenment
also... punishments for "white collar" crimes
i don't think the protests will do anything
[You]
fuck regulation. beuocracy is what is making education so expensive. students are in debt because of the 100 tiers of beurocrats the money has to go through before it reaches the schools.
[John R. Meyer]
history has shown, time and time again, the only thing to effect real change is violence
no, lack of regulation got us in the mess we are in... and that is pure and simple fact.
socialized countries have nearly free education... that is the model we need to go after.
[You]
maybe I am a bit of an anarchist here, but kill all corporate interests and all regulations and let everyone fight it out.
so you're a socialist?
[John R. Meyer]
no, that cannot work in the consolidated environment that our corporate culture has evolved in to
the government exists to protect the citizens welfare and ability to live a fulfilling life
part of that is to provide social benefit, like education and healthcare
every other developed nation has a handle on this
except for us
i am not a socialist, but government has a role to play in some markets
[You]
ok social benefit and healthcare, but what about social security? if you want to distribute the wealth it might as well just been added on to the tax rate, it's not helping anyone.
and what about stray organizations that aren't doing any good and costing the government millions like the TSA?
this is kind of a different conversation now
[John R. Meyer]
we need to fix our corporate tax rate... that system is a joke.
[You]
but it's all a result of shitty regulation.
[John R. Meyer]
the TSA is nothing in comparison to our budget for blowing up brown people
[You]
true fact.
[John R. Meyer]
our foreign policy is the elephant in the room
[You]
but for some reason, not one who touches political conversation has the balls to admit that maybe we need to bring it in and regroup and focus on our own problems for a bit, instead of killing brown people.
right, the elephant in the room implies don't talk about it right?
[John R. Meyer]
right
defense cuts and foreign aid cuts should be taking up substantial time on the national stage
[You]
but what about all of the technology that comes out of war? oh wait, monsanto is still genetically engineering the world and NASA has no money. fuck all
[John R. Meyer]
the military industrial complex is a PRIME example of how money has corrupted government
at least as bad as the "banksters"
oh shit... prime. i need to check engadet.
[You]
nah, just because they can afford to pay for something doesn't mean it wasn't a good idea. pretty much all of computer technology came from military funding. try government supported monopolies. which goes back to corporations getting too large which in turn goes back to patent laws and general bad decisions. thank got the AT&T merger got shot down.
althought since verizon is the best, the market could eventually decide they should be a monopoly.
[John R. Meyer]
the MIC has produced some great technology
but unfortunately it has produced an untenable global climate
and that trade off is unacceptable
[You]
but we killed Osama and we killed Sadam
we won right?
[John R. Meyer]
our foreign policy continues to breed terrorists that will fill their shoes
actions have consequences
[You]
I believe in educating the world, you really think we could make a difference if we spend more money on educating people to not become terrorist that it would make a difference?
[John R. Meyer]
if we didn't meddle in foreign governments we wouldn't have to worry
[You]
i am all for bomb em and drop em
just forget them
[John R. Meyer]
a great way to make even more terrorists!
[You]
kill all the people fighting each other and the UN makes us pay reperations
oh well
probably cheaper than 8 trillion in debt
[John R. Meyer]
or.. do nothing.
then there isn't a major problem.
[You]
well the benefit of being a superpower is we don't have to care about the consequences
[John R. Meyer]
it is clear that we do
the war on terror is bankrupting the country
that is the consequence
the terrorists are winning, our country is in shambles and (as i see it) there is no hope of a fix
this country is a shit hole for pretty much anything there is a metric for (among developed counties)
the one title that will make me feel like a success: expatriate
economic mobility: ha!
statups: ha!
healthcare: ha!
livable minimum wage: ha!
consumer protection: ha!
employee protection: ha!
i'm just glad i'm smart and not poor
but not everyone has the option or ability
and they shouldn't suffer because of it
otherwise, what is the point of prosperity?
[You]
hmmm.
i didn't have a problem getting a job. coincidence? not everyone is created equal. that's a bullshit lie that idiots tell you to get you to stop fighting on the playground. i don't mean to incite anger, but it isn't just coincidence.
[John R. Meyer]
all i heard was "I DON'T UNDERSTAND SCIENCE"
you can't be that dumb
we are all on a bell curve, sir
Today
[John R. Meyer]
if you can't see that, maybe you are on the left
[You]
yeah, and how much science in the form of statistics goes in to figuring out what the livable minimum wage is? i am sruvival of the fittest. I am just out of college and considering buying a house. what differentiates me from all the others? opporunity, sure, the market is bad so the time for buying is good.
politics is the problem here. politics isn't science.
[John R. Meyer]
ability, socioeconomic status, and luck
that is what differentiates you
[You]
thank you. I am the 1%
[John R. Meyer]
a) not yet.
b) it wasn't a compliment
[You]
http://www.financialsamurai.com/2011/04/12/how-much-money-do-the-top-income-earners-make-percent/
[John R. Meyer]
you make 400k?
if you made 400k you'd have better plates
[You]
hmm, I am getting new plates.
[John R. Meyer]
i grew up in the top 1%
shit, even higher
but at least i recognize the normal distribution of society
[You]
then how are you such a liberal douche? (mostly joking <3)
[John R. Meyer]
because i think
[You]
ahahaha
yes
[John R. Meyer]
conservatism is a disease
[You]
i g2g bed. as usual it was an absolute pleasure debating with you. educational as well. I hope you decide to reply to my post.
[John R. Meyer]
i respect conservatives about as much as i respect people who believe in god
(mostly kidding <3)
[You]
lol, fuck you
:)
[John R. Meyer]
haha. night!
[You]
