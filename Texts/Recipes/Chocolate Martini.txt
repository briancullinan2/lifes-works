Cocoa Powder 
Powdered sugar 
Caramel sauce, in a squeeze bottle with a very small tip 
Chocolate Sauce 
2 ounces vanilla vodka (recommended: Stoli Vanilla) 
2 ounces white creme de cacao 
2 ounces Praline New Orleans Style Pecan Liqueur 
Crushed ice 
Roasted pecan halves, for garnish 
Roughly chopped chocolate squares, for garnish 

First, sweeten the cocoa powder to your liking by mixing the cocoa and powdered sugar. Take a large martini glass and very carefully coat the rim in caramel sauce from the squeeze bottle, being careful not to let it drip too far down the sides. 
Then, dip the entire rim of the glass into the sweetened cocoa powder, being sure to coat all of the caramel. The desired effect is a chocolate dusted caramel rim. If available, I also like to put just a drop of chocolate syrup at the bottom of the glass for color. 

For the drink, shake the vodka, creme de cacao and praline liqueur in a martini shaker with ice to chill. Fill the martini glass nearly full with crushed or shaved ice, being careful not to touch the rim. Strain the drink into the martini glass. 

Garnish atop the floating ice with a roasted pecan half and a small piece of chopped chocolate. Alternately, I have garnished it with a half of a Turtle candy by making an incision and hanging it on the rim of the glass. Whichever you prefer. 

Also, if you prefer your martini to LOOK chocolatey, I would use the dark creme de cacao. However, I find the decorative elements (powder and garnish) stand out when the drink is more translucent.
