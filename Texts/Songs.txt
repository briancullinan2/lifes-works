Wishing It Was by Santana
Beauty and grace is what touches me most
Good time can put me in fear
Always feel safe when things are bad
So I cannot let you come near
It seems that I thrive on the dark side of things
I always feel alive when the death bell rings
Now you have come and bring out the tears in me

Pain never makes me cry, but happiness does
It's so strange to watch my life walk by
Wishing it was
Wishing it was more like a fantasy
Where everyone surprises me
Wishing it was

This feeling won’t last cause I cannot survive
I tell you I’ve been here before
When it’s movin this fast
It's a matter of time
One of us walks out that door
It seems that I thrive on the dark side of things
I always feel alive when the death bell rings
Now you come and you bring out the tears in me

Pain never makes me cry, but happiness does
It's so strange to watch my life walk by
Wishing it was
Wishing it was more like a fantasy
Where everyone surprises me
Wishing it was

Give this some thought
And I’m sure you will know
This is the way it must be
Emotions will rise, emotions will flow
You bring out the tears in me

It's so strange to watch your life walk and where everyday
I've been burning the candle at both ends
And lied the truth I can’t pretend
This is why I will not stay baby
Just like that I’m on my way

Pain never makes me cry, but happiness does
It's so strange to watch my life walk by
Wishing it was
Wishing it was more like a fantasy
Where everyone surprises me
Wishing it was



Space Between By Dave Mathews Band
You cannot quit me so quickly
There's no hope in you for me
No corner you could squeeze me
But I got all the time for you, love

The Space Between
The tears we cry
Is the laughter keeps us coming back for more
The Space Between
The wicked lies we tell
And hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again?
These fickle, fuddled words confuse me
Like 'Will it rain today?'
Waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted games we're playing

We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What wild-eyed beast you be
The Space Between
The wicked lies we tell
And hope to keep safe from the pain

Will I hold you again?
Will I hold...

Look at us spinning out in
The madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like a devil
In a church in the middle of a crowded room
All we can do, my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down

The Space Between
Where you're smiling high
Is where you'll find me if I get to go
The Space Between
The bullets in our firefight
Is where I'll be hiding, waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splash in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into...
The Space Between
Our wicked lies
Is where we hope to keep safe from pain

Take my hand
'Cause we're walking out of here
Oh, right out of here
Love is all we need here

The Space Between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding, waiting for you
The Space Between
Your heart and mine
Is the space we'll fill with time
The Space Between...



Silent Warrior by Enigma
Long ago, for many years
White men came in the name of GOD.
They took their land, they took their lives
A new age has just begun.

They lost their GODS, they lost their smile
They cried for help for the last time.
Liberty was turning into chains
But all the white men said
That's the cross of changes.

In the name of GOD - The fight for gold
These were the changes.
Tell me - is it right - In the name of GOD
These kind of changes?

They tried to fight for liberty
Without a chance in hell, they gave up.
White men won in the name of GOD
With the cross as alibi.

There's no GOD who ever tried
To change the world in this way.
But for the ones who abuse his name
There'll be no chance to escape
On judgment day.

In the name of GOD - The fight for gold
These were the changes.
Tell me - Is it right - In the name of GOD
These kind of changes?

Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why,
The white men said:
That's the cross of changes?
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why,
In the name of GOD
These kind of changes.



Return To Innocence by Enigma
Love - Devotion
Feeling - Emotion

Don't be afraid to be weak
Don't be too proud to be strong
Just look into your heart my friend
That will be the return to yourself
The return to innocence.

If you want, then start to laugh
If you must, then start to cry
Be yourself don't hide
Just believe in destiny.

Don't care what people say
Just follow your own way
Don't give up and use the chance
To return to innocence.

That's not the beginning of the end
That's the return to yourself
The return to innocence.



Out From The Deep by Enigma
We came out from the deep
To learn to love, to learn how to live
We came out from the deep
To avoid the mistakes we made.

That's why we are here!

We came out from the deep
To help and understand, but not to kill
It takes many lives till we succeed
To clear the debts of many hundred years.

That's why we are here!



Follow Me by Uncle Kracker
You don't know how you met me
you don't know why you can't turn around and say good-bye.
All you know is when I'm with you
I make you free
and swim through your veins like a fish in the sea
I'm singin'

Follow me, everything is all right.
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
and if you want to leave
I can guarantee you won't find nobody else like me.

I'm not worried 'bout the ring you wear
cause as long as no one knows
then nobody could care.
You're feelin' guilty
and I'm well aware
but you don't look ashamed, and baby
I'm not scared.
I'm singin'

Follow me, everything is all right.
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
and if you want to leave
I can guarantee you won't find nobody else like me.

You're feelin' guilty
and I'm well aware
but you don't look ashamed, and baby
I'm not scared.

Won't give you money
I can't give you the sky.
You're better off if you don't ask why.
I'm not the reason that you go astray and it will be all right if you don't ask me to stay.

I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
and if you want to leave
I can guarantee you won't find nobody else like me.

You don't know how you met me
you don't know why you can't turn around and say good-bye.
All you know is when I'm with you
I make you free
and swim through your veins like a fish in the sea
I'm singin'

Follow me, everything is all right.
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
and if you want to leave
I can guarantee you won't find nobody else like me.



Ride Wit Me by Nelly
If you wanna go and take a ride wit me
We three-wheelin in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high wit me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-y
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feelin right
Lookin tryin to spot somethin real nice
Lookin for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home 
(I can take home)
She can be 18 (18) wit an attitude 
or 19 kinda snotty actin real rude
But as long as you a thicky thicky thick girl you know that it's on 
(Know that it's on)
I peep something comin towards me on the dance floor 
Sexy and real slow (hey) 
Sayin she was peepin and I dig the last video
So when Nelly, can we go; how could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you boo from way over there

If you wanna go and take a ride wit me
We three-wheelin in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high wit me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-y
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Face and body front and back, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringin nuttin back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
when the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that, fo' dot six Range
Watch the candy paint change, everytime I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Makin a livin off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Runnin credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm gettin pages out of New Jersey, from Courtney B.
Tellin me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it?  Damn right, I be on the next flight
Payin cash; first class - sittin next to Vanna White

If you wanna go and take a ride wit me
We three-wheelin in the fo' with the gold D's

Check, check -- yo, I know somethin you don't know
And I got somethin to tell ya
You won't believe how many people, straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers askin me fo' dough
And I'm yellin, "I can't help ya"
"But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?"
Hell no (what's witchu?!) you for real?!

Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggaz wanna know why, why I fly by
But yo it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should - f*** me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggaz, wishin you was niggaz
Poppin like we drug dealers, sippin Cris-sy, bubb' mackin
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, tellin me to leave wit you and your friends
So if shorty wanna... knock, we knockin to this
And if shorty wanna... rock, we rockin to this
And if shorty wanna... pop, we poppin the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I f*** fly bit**es; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggaz starin or they diss
Honies lookin all they wish - come on boo, gimme kiss
