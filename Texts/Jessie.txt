you act like you are the supreme authority on everyone's intentions/actions/feelings.
you act like you know everything and then you argue until you have eghausted your point completely, no matter if people agree or disagree with you
you talk about people in a negative way, but then tack on the disclaimer, "that doesn't mean i don't like them as a person or think less of them", or "i hold myself to higher standards", no matter how terrible the things you say about the person are
you add the disclaimer, "a real friend tells you the truth", when it isn't even the truth, only your perception and opinion, a real friend tells you what you need to hear and is there for you, not giving someone the blunt truth about what you think about them
your opinions about my behavior are NOT truth, they are only your honest opinion, which still makes them opinions
you make wild assumptions, 
How do you know that Heather intended her comment to be hurtful (i instigated it)?  She is more interested in being friends than having a sexual relationship and risking catching a terrible disease
How you do know what she is planning for our relationship (she asked me over for dinner, and we talked about our flaking out on each other, progress)?  How do you know Kelsey didn't like me flirting with her (she seemed very happy to recieve the attention)?  How do you know I was even flirting with her (i had no expectations, i was enjoying myself until you yelled at me)?  How the hell did you ever come to the conclusion that I don't care about Teresa (i was trying to stay out of the way, i thought you had everything under control)?
You do not know anything, and you act like you know everything
You are not as smart and observant as you think you are
You just want the attention of two guys, and now that i have started moving on, you roll your eyes at me for being hurt and upset for months over you, you add the disclaimer, "it is an easy fix" when it is absolutely not
You are not a nice person when you are drunk
You are not even a good friend, you tell stories all the time of how your friends ditch you, or you don't have any friends of your own, but yet you still act like you know everything about people and their relationships
A good friend is someone who will stand with you in the bathroom while you cry about no one coming to see you, someone who makes you feel better when you are upset, not someone who tells you that no one cares about you
You do not make me feel better when i am upset, you only tell me that it is my own fault for chasing/briskly walking after these girls
You never admit to being wrong, you only argue your point until we can't stand it anymore
You are the type of person that would look at this list and point out all of the spelling errors, with no regard for the words on it
