People Lie More by Phone Than by E-Mail

People are twice as likely to lie if they’re talking on the phone than if they’re writing an e-mail, according to the first study to compare honesty levels by communication media.

In the study, lies made up 14 percent of emails, 21 percent of instant messages, 27 percent of face-to-face interactions--and 37 percent of phone calls. Although psychologists expected the most lies to come through via e-mail, as this would allow the most detached way of communication, researchers believe the fact that e-mails are recorded, and could therefore be re-read later, keeps lying in check.

Further, it appears that people are more likely to lie in real time, such as on the phone, than when they have time to think of a response, as is the case with e-mail. The researchers concluded that e-mail may be the best way of communicating in situations where honesty is of utmost importance.
