Introduction 

Purpose of This Document 

This document is to be used by Payment Application-Qualified Security Assessors (PA-QSAs) conducting payment application reviews, so that 
software vendors can validate that a payment application complies with the PCI Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA-DSS). This 
document is also to be used by PA-QSAs as a template to create the Report on Validation. 

Additional resources including Attestations of Validation, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, 
Abbreviations, and Acronyms are available on the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) website—www.pcisecuritystandards.org. 

Relationship between PCI DSS and PA-DSS 

Use of a PA-DSS compliant application by itself does not make an entity PCI DSS compliant, since that application must be implemented into a 
PCI DSS compliant environment and according to the PA-DSS Implementation Guide provided by the payment application vendor (per PA-DSS 
Requirement 13.1). 

The requirements for the Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA-DSS) are derived from the Payment Card Industry Data Security 
Standard (PCI DSS) Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures. This document, which can be found at www.pcisecuritystandards.org, 
details what is required to be PCI DSS compliant (and therefore what a payment application must support to facilitate a customer’s PCI DSS 
compliance). 

Traditional PCI Data Security Standard compliance may not apply directly to payment application vendors since most vendors do not store, 
process, or transmit cardholder data. However, since these payment applications are used by customers to store, process, and transmit 
cardholder data, and customers are required to be PCI Data Security Standard compliant, payment applications should facilitate, and not prevent, 
the customers' PCI Data Security Standard compliance. Just a few of the ways payment applications can prevent compliance follow. 

    1.    Storage of magnetic stripe data and/or equivalent data on the chip in the customer's network after authorization; 

    2.   Applications that require customers to disable other features required by the PCI Data Security Standard, like anti-virus software or 
        firewalls, in order to get the payment application to work properly; and 

    3.   Vendors’ use of unsecured methods to connect to the application to provide support to the customer. 

Secure payment applications, when implemented in a PCI DSS-compliant environment, will minimize the potential for security breaches leading to 
compromises of full magnetic stripe data, card verification codes and values (CAV2, CID, CVC2, CVV2), PINs and PIN blocks, and the damaging 
fraud resulting from these breaches.

Copyright  2010 PCI Security Standards Council LLC                                                                                       October 2010 

----------------------- Page 5-----------------------

Scope of PA-DSS 

The PA-DSS applies to software vendors and others who develop payment applications that store, process, or transmit cardholder data as part of 
authorization or settlement, where these payment applications are sold, distributed, or licensed to third parties. 

The following guide can be used to determine whether PA-DSS applies to a given payment application: 

          PA-DSS does apply to payment applications that are typically sold and installed “off the shelf” without much             Note: 
         customization by software vendors. 
                                                                                                                                   All validated payment 
          PA-DSS does apply to payment applications provided in modules, which typically includes a “baseline”                     application products must 
         module and other modules specific to customer types or functions, or customized per customer request. PA-                 not be beta versions. 
         DSS may only apply to the baseline module if that module is the only one performing payment functions 
         (once confirmed by a PA-QSA). If other modules also perform payment functions, PA-DSS applies to those modules as well. Note that it is 
         considered a “best practice” for software vendors to isolate payment functions into a single or small number of baseline modules, 
         reserving other modules for non-payment functions. This best practice (though not a requirement) can limit the number of modules subject 
         to PA-DSS. 

          PA-DSS does NOT apply to payment applications offered by application or service providers only as a service (unless such applications 
         are also sold, licensed, or distributed to third parties) because: 

          1)    The application is a service offered to customers (typically merchants) and the customers do not have the ability to manage, install, 
              or control the application or its environment; 

          2)   The application is covered by the application or service provider’s own PCI DSS review (this coverage should be confirmed by the 
              customer); and/or 

          3)   The application is not sold, distributed, or licensed to third parties. 

       Examples of these “software as a service” payment applications include: 

          1)    Those offered by Application Service Providers (ASP) who host a payment application on their site for their customers’ use. Note that 
               PA-DSS would apply, however, if the ASP’s payment application were also sold to, and implemented on, a third-party site, and the 
              application was not covered by the ASP’s PCI DSS review. 

          2)   Virtual terminal applications that reside on a service providers’ site and are used by merchants to enter their payment transactions. 
               Note that PA-DSS would apply if the virtual terminal application has a portion that is distributed to, and implemented on, the 
               merchant’s site, and was not covered by the virtual terminal provider’s PCI DSS review. 

          PA-DSS does NOT apply to non-payment applications that are part of a payment application suite. Such applications (for example, a 
         fraud-monitoring, scoring or detection application included in a suite) can be, but are not required to be, covered by PA-DSS if the whole 
         suite is assessed together. However, if a payment application is part of a suite that relies on PA-DSS requirements being met by controls 
         in other applications in the suite, a single PA-DSS assessment should be performed for the payment application and all other applications 
         in the suite upon which it relies. These applications should not be assessed separately from other applications they rely upon since all PA- 
         DSS requirements are not met within a single application.

Copyright  2010 PCI Security Standards Council LLC                                                                                               October 2010 

----------------------- Page 6-----------------------

         PA-DSS does NOT apply to a payment application developed for and sold to a single customer for the sole use of that customer, since 
        this application will be covered as part of the customer’s normal PCI DSS compliance review. Note that such an application (which may be 
         referred to as a “bespoke” application) is sold to only one customer (usually a large merchant or service provider), and it is designed and 
        developed according to customer-provided specifications. 

         PA-DSS does NOT apply to payment applications developed by merchants and service providers if used only in-house (not sold, 
        distributed, or licensed to a third party), since this in-house developed payment application would be covered as part of the merchant’s or 
        service provider’s normal PCI DSS compliance. 

    For example, for the last two bullets above, whether the in-house developed or “bespoke” payment application stores prohibited sensitive 
    authentication data or allows complex passwords would be covered as part of the merchant’s or service provider’s normal PCI DSS 
    compliance efforts and would not require a separate PA-DSS assessment. 

The following list, while not all-inclusive, illustrates applications that are NOT payment applications for purposes of PA-DSS (and therefore do not 
need to undergo PA-DSS reviews): 

         Operating systems onto which a payment application is installed (for example, Windows, Unix)              Note: PCI SSC will ONLY list 
         Database systems that store cardholder data (for example, Oracle)                                         applications that are payment 
                                                                                                                   applications. 
         Back-office systems that store cardholder data (for example, for reporting or customer service 
         purposes) 
The scope of the PA-DSS review should include the following: 

         Coverage of all payment application functionality, including but not limited to 1) end-to-end payment functions (authorization and 
        settlement), 2) input and output, 3) error conditions, 4) interfaces and connections to other files, systems, and/or payment applications or 
        application components, 5) all cardholder data flows, 6) encryption mechanisms, and 7) authentication mechanisms. 

         Coverage of guidance the payment application vendor is expected to provide to customers and resellers/integrators (see PA-DSS 
         Implementation Guide later in this document) to ensure 1) customer knows how to implement the payment application in a PCI DSS- 
        compliant manner and 2) customer is clearly told that certain payment application and environment settings may prohibit their PCI DSS 
        compliance. Note that the payment application vendor may be expected to provide such guidance even when the specific setting 1) 
        cannot be controlled by the payment application vendor once the application is installed by the customer or 2) is the responsibility of the 
        customer, not the payment application vendor. 

         Coverage of all selected platforms for the reviewed payment application version (included platforms should be specified). 

         Coverage of tools used by or within the payment application to access and/or view cardholder data (reporting tools, logging tools, etc.) 

PA-DSS Applicability to Payment Applications on Hardware Terminals 

Payment applications designed to operate on hardware terminals (also known as a standalone or dedicated POS terminal) may undergo a PA- 
DSS review if the vendor wishes to achieve validation and if PA-DSS compliance requirements can be met. Reasons a vendor may wish to 
undergo a PA-DSS validation for a payment application on a hardware terminal include, but are not limited to, business needs and compliance 

PCI PA-DSS Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures, v2.0                                                                                 Page 6 
Copyright  2010 PCI Security Standards Council LLC                                                                                        October 2010

obligations. This section provides guidance for vendors who wish to gain PA-DSS validation for resident payment applications on hardware 
terminals. 

There are two ways for a resident payment application on a hardware terminal to achieve PA-DSS validation: 

     1.   The resident payment application directly meets all PA-DSS requirements and is validated according to standard PA-DSS procedures. 

     2.   The resident payment application does not meet all PA-DSS requirements, but the hardware that the application is resident on is listed on 
         the PCI SSC’s Approved PIN Transaction Security (PTS) Devices List as a current PCI PTS approved Point of Interaction (POI) device. In 
         this scenario, it may be possible for the application to satisfy PA-DSS requirements through a combination of the PA-DSS and PTS 
         validated controls. 

The remainder of this section applies only to payment applications that that are resident on a validated PCI PTS approved POI device. 

If one or more PA-DSS requirements cannot be met by the payment application directly, they may be satisfied indirectly by controls tested as part 
of the PCI PTS validation. For a hardware device to be considered for inclusion in a PA-DSS review, the hardware device MUST be validated as a 
PCI PTS approved POI device and be listed on the PCI SSC’s Approved PTS Devices List. The PTS validated POI device, which provides a 
trusted computing environment, will become a “required dependency” for the payment application, and the combination of application and 
hardware will be listed together on the PA-DSS List of Validation Payment Applications. 

When conducting the PA-DSS assessment, the PA-QSA must fully test the payment application with its dependant hardware against all PA-DSS 
requirements. If the PA-QSA determines that one or more PA-DSS requirements cannot be met by the resident payment application, but they are 
met by controls validated under PCI PTS, the PA-QSA must: 

     1.   Clearly document which requirements are met as stated per PA-DSS (as usual); 

     2.   Clearly document which requirement was met via PCI PTS in the “In Place” box for that requirement; 

     3.   Include a thorough explanation as to why the payment application could not meet the PA-DSS requirement; 

     4.   Document the procedures that were conducted to determine how that requirement was fully met through a PCI PTS validated control; 

     5.   List the PCI PTS validated hardware terminal as a required dependency in the Executive Summary of the Report on Validation. 

Once the PA-QSA’s validation of the payment application is complete and is subsequently accepted by the PCI SSC, the PTS validated hardware 
device will be listed as a dependency for the payment application on the PA-DSS List of Validated Applications. 

Resident payment applications on hardware terminals that are validated through a combination of PA-DSS and PCI PTS controls must meet the 
following criteria: 

     1.   Be provided together to the customer (both hardware terminal and application), OR, if provided separately, the application vendor and/or 
         the reseller/integrator must package the application for distribution such that it will operate only on the hardware terminal it has been 
         validated to run on. 

     2.   Enabled by default to support a customer’s PCI DSS compliance. 

     3.   Include ongoing support and updates to maintain PCI DSS compliance. 

     4.   If the application is separately sold, distributed or licensed to customers, the vendor must provide details of the dependant hardware 
         required for use with the application, in accordance with its PA-DSS validation listing.

Roles and Responsibilities 

There are several stakeholders in the payment application community. Some of these stakeholders have a more direct participation in the PA-DSS 
assessment process—vendors, PA-QSAs and PCI SSC. Other stakeholders that are not directly involved with the assessment process should be 
aware of the overall process to facilitate their associated business decisions. 

The following defines the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders in the payment application community. Those stakeholders that are 
involved in the assessment process have those related responsibilities listed. 

Payment Brands 

American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide, and Visa Inc. are the payment brands that founded the 
PCI SSC. These payment brands are responsible for developing and enforcing any programs related to PA-DSS compliance, including, but not 
limited to, the following: 

        Any requirements, mandates, or dates for use of PA-DSS compliant payment applications 

        Any fines or penalties related to use of non-compliant payment applications 

The payment brands may define compliance programs, mandates, dates, etc., using PA-DSS and the validated payment applications listed by PCI 
SSC. Through these compliance programs, the payment brands promote use of the listed validated payment applications. 

Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) 

PCI SSC is the standards body that maintains the payment card industry standards, including the PCI DSS and PA-DSS. In relation to PA-DSS, 
PCI SSC: 

        Is a centralized repository for PA-DSS Reports of Validation (ROVs) 

        Performs Quality Assurance (QA) reviews of PA-DSS ROVs to confirm report consistency and quality 

        Lists PA-DSS validated payment applications on the website 

        Qualifies and trains PA-QSAs to perform PA-DSS reviews 

        Maintains and updates the PA-DSS standard and related documentation according to a standards lifecycle management process 

Note that PCI SSC does not approve reports from a validation perspective. The role of the PA-QSA is to document the payment application’s 
compliance to the PA-DSS as of the date of the assessment. Additionally, PCI SSC performs QA to assure that the PA-QSAs accurately and 
thoroughly document PA-DSS assessments. 

Software Vendors 

Software vendors (“vendors”) develop payment applications that store, process, or transmit cardholder data as part of authorization or settlement, 
and then sell, distribute, or license these payment applications to third parties (customers or resellers/integrators). Vendors are responsible for:

          Creating PA-DSS compliant payment applications that facilitate and do not prevent their customers’ PCI DSS compliance (the application 
         cannot require an implementation or configuration setting that violates a PCI DSS requirement) 

          Following PCI DSS requirements whenever the vendor stores, processes or transmits cardholder data (for example, during customer 
         troubleshooting) 
          Creating a PA-DSS Implementation Guide, specific to each payment application, according to the requirements in this document 

          Educating customers, resellers, and integrators on how to install and configure the payment applications in a PCI DSS-compliant manner 

          Ensuring payment applications meet PA-DSS by successfully passing a PA-DSS review as specified in this document 

PA-QSAs 

PA-QSAs are QSAs that have been qualified and trained by PCI SSC to perform PA-DSS reviews. 

PA-QSAs are responsible for:                                                                                          Note: Not all QSAs are PA- 

          Performing assessments on payment applications in accordance with the Security Assessment                   QSAs—there are additional 
          Procedures and the PA-QSA Validation Requirements                                                           qualification requirements that 
          Providing an opinion regarding whether the payment application meets PA-DSS requirements                    must be met for a QSA to 
                                                                                                                      become a PA-QSA. 
          Providing adequate documentation within the ROV to demonstrate the payment application’s 
         compliance to the PA-DSS 

          Submitting the ROV to PCI SSC, along with the Attestation of Validation (signed by both PA-QSA and vendor) 

          Maintaining an internal quality assurance process for their PA-QSA efforts 

It is the PA-QSA’s responsibility to state whether the payment application has achieved compliance. PCI SSC does not approve ROVs from a 
technical compliance perspective, but performs QA reviews on the ROVs to assure that the reports adequately document the demonstration of 
compliance. 

Resellers and Integrators 

Resellers and integrators are those entities that sell, install, and/or service payment applications on behalf of software vendors or others. Resellers 
and integrators are responsible for: 

          Implementing a PA-DSS-compliant payment application into a PCI DSS-compliant environment (or instructing the merchant to do so) 
          Configuring the payment application (where configuration options are provided) according to the PA-DSS Implementation Guide provided 
         by the vendor 

          Configuring the payment application (or instructing the merchant to do so) in a PCI DSS-compliant manner 

          Servicing the payment applications (for example, troubleshooting, delivering remote updates, and providing remote support) according to 
         the PA-DSS Implementation Guide and PCI DSS 

Resellers and integrators do not submit payment applications for assessment. Products may only be submitted by the vendor.

Customers 

Customers are merchants, service providers, or others who buy or receive a third-party payment application to 
                                                                                                                        Note: A PA-DSS compliant 
store, process, or transmit cardholder data as part of authorizing or settling of payment transactions. Customers 
                                                                                                                        payment application alone 
who want to use applications that are compliant with PA-DSS are responsible for:                                        is no guarantee of PCI DSS 

          Implementing a PA-DSS-compliant payment application into a PCI DSS-compliant environment                      compliance. 

          Configuring the payment application (where configuration options are provided) according to the PA-DSS 
         Implementation Guide provided by the vendor 

          Configuring the payment application in a PCI DSS-compliant manner 

          Maintaining the PCI DSS-compliant status for both the environment and the payment application configuration 

PA-DSS Implementation Guide 

Validated payment applications must be capable of being implemented in a PCI DSS-compliant manner. Software vendors are required to provide 
a PA-DSS Implementation Guide to instruct their customers and resellers/integrators on secure product implementation, to document the secure 
configuration specifics mentioned throughout this document, and to clearly delineate vendor, reseller/integrator, and customer responsibilities for 
meeting PCI DSS requirements. It should detail how the customer and/or reseller/integrator should enable security settings within the customer’s 
network. For example, the PA-DSS Implementation Guide should cover responsibilities and basic features of PCI DSS password security even if 
this is not controlled by the payment application, so that the customer or reseller/integrator understands how to implement secure passwords for 
PCI DSS compliance. 

Payment applications, when implemented according to the PA-DSS Implementation Guide, and when implemented into a PCI DSS-compliant 
environment, should facilitate and support customers’ PCI DSS compliance. 

Refer to Appendix A: Summary of Contents for the PA-DSS Implementation Guide for a comparison of responsibilities for implementing the 
controls specified in the PA-DSS Implementation Guide. 

Payment Application Qualified Security Assessor (PA-QSA) Requirements 

Only Payment Application Qualified Security Assessors (PA-QSAs) employed by Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) companies are allowed to 
perform PA-DSS assessments. Please see the Qualified Security Assessor list at www.pcisecuritystandards.org for a list of companies qualified to 
perform PA-DSS assessments. 

          The PA-QSA must utilize the testing procedures documented in this Payment Application Data Security Standard document. 

          The PA-QSA must have access to a laboratory where the validation process is to occur.

----------------------- Page 11-----------------------

Testing Laboratory 

          Testing laboratories can exist in either of two locations: onsite at the PA-QSA location, or onsite at the software vendor’s location. 

          The testing laboratory should be able to simulate real-world use of the payment application. 

          The PA-QSA must validate the clean installation of the lab environment to ensure the environment truly simulates a real world situation 
         and that the vendor has not modified or tampered with the environment in any way. 

          Please refer to Appendix B: Confirmation of Testing Laboratory Configuration Specific to PA-DSS Assessment in this document for 
         detailed requirements for the laboratory and related laboratory processes. 

          PA-QSA must complete and submit Appendix B, completed for the specific laboratory used for the payment application under review, as 
         part of the completed PA-DSS report.

PCI DSS Applicability Information 

(Excerpted from PCI DSS) 

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) applies wherever account data is stored, processed or transmitted. Account Data 
consists of Cardholder Data plus Sensitive Authentication Data, as follows. 

                                   Cardholder Data includes:                    Sensitive Authentication Data includes: 

                                  Primary Account Number (PAN)                        Full magnetic stripe data or equivalent 
                                  Cardholder Name                                    on a chip 

                                  Expiration Date                                     CAV2/CVC2/CVV2/CID 

                                  Service Code                                        PINs/PIN blocks 

The primary account number (PAN) is the defining factor in the applicability of PCI DSS requirements and PA-DSS. PCI DSS 
requirements are applicable if a primary account number (PAN) is stored, processed, or transmitted. If PAN is not stored, processed, or 
transmitted, PCI DSS and PA-DSS do not apply. 

If cardholder name, service code, and/or expiration date are stored, processed or transmitted with the PAN, or are otherwise present in the 
cardholder data environment, they must be protected in accordance with all PCI DSS requirements except Requirements 3.3 and 3.4, which apply 
only to PAN. 

PCI DSS represents a minimum set of control objectives which may be enhanced by local, regional and sector laws and regulations. Additionally, 
legislation or regulatory requirements may require specific protection of personally identifiable information or other data elements (for example, 
cardholder name), or define an entity’s disclosure practices related to consumer information. Examples include legislation related to consumer 
data protection, privacy, identity theft, or data security. PCI DSS does not supersede local or regional laws, government regulations or other legal 
requirements. 

The following table from the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) illustrates commonly used elements of cardholder data and 
sensitive authentication data, whether storage of that data is permitted or prohibited, and whether this data needs to be protected. This table is 
not meant to be exhaustive, but is presented to illustrate the different type of requirements that apply to each data element.

PCI DSS Requirements 3.3 and 3.4 apply only to PAN. If PAN is stored with other elements of cardholder data, only the PAN must be rendered 
unreadable according to PCI DSS Requirement 3.4. 

PCI DSS only applies if PANs are stored, processed, and/or transmitted.

                                      7.d All testing is executed by the PA-QSA (the vendor cannot 
                                      run tests against their own application). 

                                      7.e All testing is either (1) performed while onsite at the 
                                      vendor’s premises, or (2) performed remotely via a network 
                                      connection using a secure link (for example, VPN). 

                                      7.f Use only test card numbers for the simulation/testing—do 
                                      not use live PANs for testing. These test cards can usually be 
                                      obtained from the vendor or a processor or acquirer. 

8.    Maintain an effective           8.a PA-QSA QA personnel verify that all platforms identified in 
     quality assurance (QA)           the PA-DSS report were included in testing.

                                      8.b PA-QSA QA personnel verify that all PA-DSS 
                                      requirements were tested against. 

                                      8.c The PA-QSA QA personnel verify that PA-QSA laboratory 
                                      configurations and processes meet requirements and were 
                                      accurately documented in the report. 

                                      8.d PA-QSA QA personnel verify that the report accurately 
                                      presents the results of testing.
